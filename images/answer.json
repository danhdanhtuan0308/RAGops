      "abstract": "Preventive Replacement Policies of Parallel/Series\nSystems with Dependent Components under Deviation\nCosts\nJiale Niu∗\nRongfang Yan\nCollege of Mathematics and Statistics\nNorthwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China\nJuly 26, 2024\nAbstract\nThis manuscript studies the preventive replacement policy for a series or parallel\nsystem consisting of n independent or dependent heterogeneous components.Firstly,\nfor the age replacement policy, Some sufficient conditions for the existence and\nuniqueness of the optimal replacement time for both the series and parallel sys-\ntems are provided.

The preventive replacement policy involves plan-\nning replacement or maintenance before a component or system fails, aiming to minimize\nsudden failures and reduce maintenance costs. Replacement before and after failure is\nreferred to as preventive replacement (PR) and corrective replacement (CR), respectively.\n∗Corresponding author: E-mail: jiale.niu@outlook.com\n1\narXiv:2407.17986v1  [math.ST]  25 Jul 2024\n\nReplacing components too late can cause system failure and high costs, while replacing\nthem too frequently can lead to unnecessary replacement expenses. Barlow & Proschan\n(1996) first proposed an age-based replacement policy based on the lifetime of a com-\nponent or system, which determines the optimal preventive replacement (or repair) time\nby minimizing the expected cost rate. Berg (1976) established a preventive maintenance\npolicy for a single-unit system, where replacement occurs either upon failure or a pre-\ndetermined critical age.\nIt was explained that among all reasonable policies, the age\nreplacement policy itself stands as the optimal criterion for decision-making. Zhao &\nNakagawa (2012) first proposed the preventive replacement policy of \"replacement last\",\ndeveloped a new expected cost rate function, and compared it with the classical \"replace-\nment first\" policy. Zhao et al. (2015)compared the advantages and disadvantages of two\npreventive replacement models: replacing components at the end of multiple working cy-\ncles and replacing components in case of random failures. Levitin et al. (2021) studies\nthe modeling and optimization of m-out-of-n standby systems affected by preventive re-\nplacement and imperfect component activation. Eryilmaz (2023) studied the age-based\npreventive replacement policy for any coherent system consisting of mutually independent\ncomponents with a common discrete life distribution. For comprehensive references on\nage replacement policy one may refer to Nakagawa (2006, 2008); Zhang et al. (2023) and\nLevitin et al. (2024).\nIn most practical situations, it is challenging to meet the assumption of “replace imme-\ndiately upon failure” in the age replacement policy. For example, ocean-going cargo ships\nmust regularly perform navigation tasks and have many critical pieces of equipment and\ncomponents, such as engines, pumps, navigation systems, and safety equipment. These\ndevices are essential for the ship’s normal operation, and their failure could lead to severe\nconsequences, including economic losses and threats to personnel safety. However, due\nto the limitations of long-distance navigation, if some components suddenly fail, the ac-\ncompanying personnel usually cannot replace the components. Replacement is typically\nplanned during the ship’s port of call to minimize the impact on navigation. In this case,\nit is more practical to consider a periodic replacement policy. Wireman (2004) has pointed\nout that the periodic replacement policy is easier to implement in the production system.\nNakagawa (2008) studied the periodic replacement policy considering the minimum main-\ntenance of components, and optimized the preventive replacement time and the number\nof working cycles of components by minimizing the expected cost rate. Zhao et al. (2014)\nproposes age and periodic replacement last models with continuous, and discrete policies.\nLiu & Wang (2021) studied the optimal periodic preventive maintenance policy for the\nsystem affected by external shocks, and explained that the system should be preventively\nreplaced at the optimized periodic time point. In particular, Zhao et al. (2024) applied the\nperiodic policy to the backup of database systems and established periodic and random\nincremental backup policies.\nSeries and parallel systems, as two very important types of systems in reliability en-\ngineering, are widely used in various industrial fields such as power generation systems,\npump systems, production systems and computing systems. For example, in power sys-\ntems, transmission lines often operate in series because electricity must pass through each\n2\n\nline continuously to be transmitted from the power plant to the user. Therefore, studying\nthe reliability and optimization of series systems is one of the keys to the safe and stable\noperation of the entire power system(Kundur (2007) and Akhtar et al. (2021)). Secondly,\nin modern computer server systems, parallel system configurations are typically used to\nensure high availability and reliability. Multiple components in a parallel system (such as\nservers, storage devices, and network devices) are redundantly configured. As long as one\nor more components work properly, the entire system can continue to operate. Parallel\ndesign can significantly improve the fault tolerance and reliability of the system(Barroso\n& Clidaras (2022) and Medara & Singh (2021)). In the past few decades, many scholars\nhave done a lot of work on the reliability optimization (including preventive maintenance)\nof these two types of systems. Nakagawa (2008) aims to minimize the expected cost rate\nand presents a preventive replacement policy for parallel systems with independent com-\nponents, focusing on optimizing the number of components in the system and determining\nthe optimal preventive replacement time. Based on the First and Last policy, Nakagawa\n& Zhao (2012) establishes the optimization of the expected cost rate of the parallel sys-\ntem in terms of the number of components and the replacement time when the number of\ncomponents is random. Sheu et al. (2018) investigated the generalized age maintenance\npolicies for a system with random working times. Wu & Scarf (2017) discussed the failure\nprocess of the system by introducing virtual components. Safaei et al. (2020) studied\nthe age replacement policy of repairable series system and parallel system. Based on the\nminimum expected cost function and the maximum availability function, two optimal age\nreplacement policy are proposed. By considering two types of system failure, Wang et al.\n(2022) studied extended preventive replacement models for series and parallel system with\nn independent non-identical components. Eryilmaz & Tank (2023) studied the discrete\ntime age replacement policy for a parallel system consisting of components with discrete\ndistributed lifetimes. For further reference on these systems, refer to Xing et al. (2021);\nLevitin et al. (2023) and Xing (2024).\nThe above research on the replacement policy of the system is mostly based on the\nassumption of component independence. However, in most practical situations, depen-\ndencies between components are inevitable. Dependence often occ",

  "summary": "**Problem**  \nThis study addresses the optimization of preventive replacement policies for series and parallel systems composed of *n* dependent heterogeneous components. Traditional models often assume component independence, but real-world systems exhibit dependencies due to shared environmental or operational loads (e.g., temperature, humidity). The paper focuses on two preventive replacement policies—age-based and periodic replacement—incorporating *deviation costs* to better reflect practical cost structures. The goal is to determine sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of optimal replacement times or periods that minimize the expected cost rate of the system.\n\n**Method/Algorithm**  \nThe authors model component dependencies using *copulas*, specifically survival copulas, which link the joint survival function of component lifetimes to their marginal distributions. Two families of copulas are discussed: Archimedean copulas (with generator functions satisfying certain convexity and monotonicity conditions) and the Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern (FGM) family.  \n- For the **age replacement policy**, preventive replacement occurs at a planned time \\( T \\) or at failure time \\( X \\), whichever comes first. The expected cost rate \\( C_s(T) \\) for a series system is formulated as:  \n  \\[\n  C_s(T) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n c_{pi} P(X_{1:n} > T) + c_f P(X_{1:n} \\leq T)}{E[\\min(X_{1:n}, T)]}\n  \\]\n  where \\( c_{pi} \\) is the preventive replacement cost for component \\( i \\), \\( c_f \\) is the corrective replacement cost for system failure, and \\( X_{1:n} \\) is the system lifetime modeled via a survival copula.  \n- For the **periodic replacement policy**, the system is replaced at fixed intervals, and the optimal number of periods is determined by minimizing the expected cost rate under dependency modeled by copulas.  \nThe paper derives sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the optimal replacement time \\( T^* \\) or optimal number of periods, using properties of the copula and cost functions. The deviation cost, introduced from Zhao et al. (2022), is incorporated to extend classical models by penalizing deviations from planned replacement times.\n\n**Data & Setup**  \nThe study is theoretical and analytical, supported by numerical examples illustrating the application of the proposed models. The system configurations considered include:  \n- Series and parallel systems with \\( n \\geq 1 \\) components.  \n- Components with heterogeneous lifetime distributions and dependencies modeled by various copulas.  \n- Cost parameters where the sum of preventive replacement costs is less than the corrective replacement cost (\\(\\sum c_{pi} < c_f\\)).  \nNumerical examples explore how dependency, number of components, and deviation cost values affect the optimal replacement policies and expected cost rates.\n\n**Key Results**  \n- The paper establishes sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of an optimal replacement time \\( T^* \\) minimizing the expected cost rate for both series and parallel systems under dependency.  \n- Incorporating deviation costs extends the classical age replacement policy, allowing for more realistic cost modeling.  \n- Numerical examples demonstrate that dependency among components significantly influences the optimal replacement time and cost rate. For instance, stronger dependency modeled by Archimedean copulas can lead to earlier optimal replacement times compared to independent components.  \n- Periodic replacement policies are shown to be practical and optimal under certain dependency structures, especially when immediate replacement upon failure is infeasible (e.g., ocean-going ships).  \n- The study provides explicit formulas for expected cost rates and mean time to failure (MTTF) under copula-based dependency models, facilitating practical computation.\n\n**Limitations**  \n- The analysis assumes knowledge of the exact copula and marginal lifetime distributions, which may be difficult to estimate accurately in practice.  \n- The models focus on preventive replacement policies without considering repair or imperfect maintenance scenarios.  \n- Numerical examples are illustrative but limited in scope; real-world validation with empirical data is not provided.  \n- The deviation cost model, while extending classical frameworks, may require further empirical calibration for different industrial contexts.\n\n**Takeaways**  \nThis research advances preventive maintenance theory by integrating component dependency via copulas and incorporating deviation costs into replacement policies for series and parallel systems. It provides rigorous conditions ensuring unique optimal replacement times, enhancing decision-making for complex systems where component",
