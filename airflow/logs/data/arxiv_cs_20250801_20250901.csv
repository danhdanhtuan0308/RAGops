SleepLiteCNN: Energy-Efficient Sleep Apnea Subtype Classification with   1-Second Resolution Using Single-Lead ECG,"Zahra Mohammadi, Siamak Mohammadi","Apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by breathing interruptions lasting at least ten seconds and occurring more than five times per hour. Accurate, high-temporal-resolution detection of sleep apnea subtypes - Obstructive, Central, and Mixed - is crucial for effective treatment and management. This paper presents an energy-efficient method for classifying these subtypes using a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with high temporal resolution to address the real-time needs of wearable devices. We evaluate a wide range of classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures on 1-second ECG windows, comparing their accuracy, complexity, and energy consumption. Based on this analysis, we introduce SleepLiteCNN, a compact and energy-efficient convolutional neural network specifically designed for wearable platforms. SleepLiteCNN achieves over 95% accuracy and a 92% macro-F1 score, while requiring just 1.8 microjoules per inference after 8-bit quantization. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis further demonstrates significant reductions in hardware resource usage, confirming its suitability for continuous, real-time monitoring in energy-constrained environments. These results establish SleepLiteCNN as a practical and effective solution for wearable device sleep apnea subtype detection.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02718v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02718v1,"eess.SP, cs.AI"
Benchmarking XRootD-HTTPS on 400Gbps Links with Variable Latencies,"Aashay Arora, Diego Davila, Frank Würthwein, John Graham, Dima Mishin, Justas Balcas, Tom Lehman, Xi Yang, Chin Guok, Harvey Newman","In anticipation of the High Luminosity-LHC era, there is a critical need to oversee software readiness for upcoming growth in network traffic for production and user data analysis access. This paper looks into software and hardware required improvements in US-CMS Tier-2 sites to be able to sustain and meet the projected 400 Gbps bandwidth demands while tackling the challenge posed by varying latencies between sites. Specifically, our study focuses on identifying the performance of XRootD HTTP third-party copies across multiple 400 Gbps links and exploring different host and transfer configurations. Our approach involves systematic testing with variations in the number of origins per cluster and CPU allocations for each origin. By replicating real network conditions and creating network ""loops"" that traverse multiple switches across the wide area network, we are able to replicate authentic network conditions",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00228v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00228v1,cs.NI
"Sequential, Parallel and Consecutive Hybrid Evolutionary-Swarm   Optimization Metaheuristics","Piotr Urbańczyk, Aleksandra Urbańczyk, Magdalena Król, Leszek Rutkowski, Marek Kisiel-Dorohinicki","The goal of this paper is twofold. First, it explores hybrid evolutionary-swarm metaheuristics that combine the features of PSO and GA in a sequential, parallel and consecutive manner in comparison with their standard basic form: Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization. The algorithms were tested on a set of benchmark functions, including Ackley, Griewank, Levy, Michalewicz, Rastrigin, Schwefel, and Shifted Rotated Weierstrass, across multiple dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid approaches achieve superior convergence and consistency, especially in higher-dimensional search spaces. The second goal of this paper is to introduce a novel consecutive hybrid PSO-GA evolutionary algorithm that ensures continuity between PSO and GA steps through explicit information transfer mechanisms, specifically by modifying GA's variation operators to inherit velocity and personal best information.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00229v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00229v1,"cs.NE, math.OC, 90C59 (Primary), 90C27, 68T20, 68W10 (Secondary), I.2.8; I.2.6; G.1.6; F.2.1; I.6.6"
Towards Higher Effective Rank in Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning using   Khatri--Rao Product,"Paul Albert, Frederic Z. Zhang, Hemanth Saratchandran, Anton van den Hengel, Ehsan Abbasnejad","Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties. Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks. To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune billion-scale parameter models.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00230v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00230v1,"cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.CV"
Correcting Misperceptions at a Glance: Using Data Visualizations to   Reduce Political Sectarianism,"Douglas Markant, Subham Sah, Alireza Karduni, Milad Rogha, My Thai, Wenwen Dou","Political sectarianism is fueled in part by misperceptions of political opponents: People commonly overestimate the support for extreme policies among members of the other party. Research suggests that correcting partisan misperceptions by informing people about the actual views of outparty members may reduce one's own expressed support for political extremism, including partisan violence and anti-democratic actions. The present study investigated how correction effects depend on different representations of outparty views communicated through data visualizations. We conducted an experiment with U.S. based participants from Prolific (N=239 Democrats, N=244 Republicans). Participants made predictions about support for political violence and undemocratic practices among members of their political outparty. They were then presented with data from an earlier survey on the actual views of outparty members. Some participants viewed only the average response (Mean-Only condition), while other groups were shown visual representations of the range of views from 75% of the outparty (Mean+Interval condition) or the full distribution of responses (Mean+Points condition). Compared to a control group that was not informed about outparty views, we observed the strongest correction effects among participants in the Mean-only and Mean+Points condition, while correction effects were weaker in the Mean+Interval condition. In addition, participants who observed the full distribution of out-party views (Mean+Points condition) were most accurate at later recalling the degree of support among the outparty. Our findings suggest that data visualizations can be an important tool for correcting pervasive distortions in beliefs about other groups. However, the way in which variability in outparty views is visualized can significantly shape how people interpret and respond to corrective information.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00233v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00233v1,cs.HC
Academic Vibe Coding: Opportunities for Accelerating Research in an Era   of Resource Constraint,"Matthew G Crowson, Leo Celi A. Celi","Academic laboratories face mounting resource constraints: budgets are tightening, grant overheads are potentially being capped, and the market rate for data-science talent significantly outstrips university compensation. Vibe coding, which is structured, prompt-driven code generation with large language models (LLMs) embedded in reproducible workflows, offers one pragmatic response. It aims to compress the idea-to-analysis timeline, reduce staffing pressure on specialized data roles, and maintain rigorous, version-controlled outputs. This article defines the vibe coding concept, situates it against the current academic resourcing crisis, details a beginner-friendly toolchain for its implementation, and analyzes inherent limitations that necessitate governance and mindful application.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00952v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00952v1,"cs.CY, cs.AI, cs.PL, cs.SE"
Quality-of-Service Aware LLM Routing for Edge Computing with Multiple   Experts,"Jin Yang, Qiong Wu, Zhiying Feng, Zhi Zhou, Deke Guo, Xu Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, leading to a significant increase in user demand for LLM services. However, cloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable responsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually deployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data privacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications. Given the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical issue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an appropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously address the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and the dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM services. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic state abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a heterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an action impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent in maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on both Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared to existing baselines.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00234v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00234v1,"cs.NI, cs.AI, cs.DC, cs.MA"
Weakly Supervised Intracranial Aneurysm Detection and Segmentation in MR   angiography via Multi-task UNet with Vesselness Prior,"Erin Rainville, Amirhossein Rasoulian, Hassan Rivaz, Yiming Xiao","Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate = 1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00235v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00235v1,"eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV"
Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language   in Unscripted Spoken English,"Bryce Anderson, Riley Galpin, Tom S. Juzek","In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has undergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target audience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are often linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to generate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes in the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a dataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from conversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends before and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated words. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of these words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and LLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no significant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of words affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language use. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by AI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem from broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training misalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These findings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and moral beliefs.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00238v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00238v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI, 68T50, I.2; I.2.7"
What's Behind the Magic? Audiences Seek Artistic Value in Generative   AI's Contributions to a Live Dance Performance,"Jacqueline Elise Bruen, Myounghoon Jeon","With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools to create art, stakeholders cannot come to an agreement on the value of these works. In this study we uncovered the mixed opinions surrounding art made by AI. We developed two versions of a dance performance augmented by technology either with or without GenAI. For each version we informed audiences of the performance's development either before or after a survey on their perceptions of the performance. There were thirty-nine participants (13 males, 26 female) divided between the four performances. Results demonstrated that individuals were more inclined to attribute artistic merit to works made by GenAI when they were unaware of its use. We present this case study as a call to address the importance of utilizing the social context and the users' interpretations of GenAI in shaping a technical explanation, leading to a greater discussion that can bridge gaps in understanding.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00239v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00239v1,"cs.HC, cs.AI"
Ambisonics Super-Resolution Using A Waveform-Domain Neural Network,"Ismael Nawfal, Symeon Delikaris Manias, Mehrez Souden, Juha Merimaa, Joshua Atkins, Elisabeth McMullin, Shadi Pirhosseinloo, Daniel Phillips","Ambisonics is a spatial audio format describing a sound field. First-order Ambisonics (FOA) is a popular format comprising only four channels. This limited channel count comes at the expense of spatial accuracy. Ideally one would be able to take the efficiency of a FOA format without its limitations. We have devised a data-driven spatial audio solution that retains the efficiency of the FOA format but achieves quality that surpasses conventional renderers. Utilizing a fully convolutional time-domain audio neural network (Conv-TasNet), we created a solution that takes a FOA input and provides a higher order Ambisonics (HOA) output. This data driven approach is novel when compared to typical physics and psychoacoustic based renderers. Quantitative evaluations showed a 0.6dB average positional mean squared error difference between predicted and actual 3rd order HOA. The median qualitative rating showed an 80% improvement in perceived quality over the traditional rendering approach.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00240v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00240v1,"eess.AS, cs.SD"
A reduced-IRKA method for large-scale $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model   order reduction,"Yiding Lin, Valeria Simoncini","The $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal Model Order Reduction (MOR) is one of the most significant frameworks for reduction methodologies for linear dynamical systems. In this context, the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (\IRKA) is a well established method for computing an optimal projection space of fixed dimension $r$, when the system has small or medium dimensions. However, for large problems the performance of \IRKA\ is not satisfactory. In this paper, we introduce a new rational Krylov subspace projection method with conveniently selected shifts, that can effectively handle large-scale problems. The projection subspace is generated sequentially, and the \IRKA\ procedure is employed on the projected problem to produce a new optimal rational space of dimension $r$ for the reduced problem, and the associated shifts. The latter are then injected to expand the projection space. Truncation of older information of the generated space is performed to limit memory requirements. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems illustrate the effectiveness of the new method.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00242v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00242v1,"math.NA, cs.NA"
Functional vs. Object-Oriented: Comparing How Programming Paradigms   Affect the Architectural Characteristics of Systems,"Briza Mel Dias de Sousa, Renato Cordeiro Ferreira, Alfredo Goldman","After decades of dominance by object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming (FP) is gaining increasing attention in the software industry. This study compares the impact of OOP and FP on the architectural characteristics of software systems. For that, it examines the design and implementation of a Digital Wallet system, developed in Kotlin (representing OOP) and Scala (representing FP). The comparison is made through both qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore how each paradigm influences the system's architectural characteristics. The self-ethnographic qualitative analysis provides a side-by-side comparison of both implementations, revealing the perspective of those writing such code. The survey-based quantitative analysis gathers feedback from developers with diverse backgrounds, showing their impressions of those reading this code.

Sinusoidal Approximation Theorem for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Sergei Gleyzer, Hanh Nguyen, Dinesh P. Ramakrishnan, Eric A. F. Reinhardt","The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem states that any continuous multivariable function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of continuous single variable functions. Subsequent simplifications of this representation involve expressing these functions as parameterized sums of a smaller number of unique monotonic functions. These developments led to the proof of the universal approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptron networks with sigmoidal activations, forming the alternative theoretical direction of most modern neural networks.   Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been recently proposed as an alternative to multilayer perceptrons. KANs feature learnable nonlinear activations applied directly to input values, modeled as weighted sums of basis spline functions. This approach replaces the linear transformations and sigmoidal post-activations used in traditional perceptrons. Subsequent works have explored alternatives to spline-based activations. In this work, we propose a novel KAN variant by replacing both the inner and outer functions in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions of learnable frequencies. Inspired by simplifications introduced by Lorentz and Sprecher, we fix the phases of the sinusoidal activations to linearly spaced constant values and provide a proof of its theoretical validity. We also conduct numerical experiments to evaluate its performance on a range of multivariable functions, comparing it with fixed-frequency Fourier transform methods and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We show that it outperforms the fixed-frequency Fourier transform and achieves comparable performance to MLPs.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00247v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00247v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, cs.NA, math.NA"
Guided Depth Map Super-Resolution via Multi-Scale Fusion U-shaped Mamba   Network,"Chenggang Guo, Hao Xu, XianMing Wan","Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba (MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task of large-scale depth map super-resolution.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00248v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00248v1,cs.CV
Jet Image Generation in High Energy Physics Using Diffusion Models,"Victor D.

The kinematic variables of quark, gluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset are mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are trained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents. We compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency models in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches based on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The fidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency models achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based diffusion models.

Robust Model Reconstruction Based on the Topological Understanding of   Point Clouds Using Persistent Homology,"Yu Chen, Hongwei Lin","Reconstructing models from unorganized point clouds presents a significant challenge, especially when the models consist of multiple components represented by their surface point clouds. Such models often involve point clouds with noise that represent multiple closed surfaces with shared regions, making their automatic identification and separation inherently complex. In this paper, we propose an automatic method that uses the topological understanding provided by persistent homology, along with representative 2-cycles of persistent homology groups, to effectively distinguish and separate each closed surface. Furthermore, we employ Loop subdivision and least squares progressive iterative approximation (LSPIA) techniques to generate high-quality final surfaces and achieve complete model reconstruction. Our method is robust to noise in the point cloud, making it suitable for reconstructing models from such data.

Through two user studies -- a comparative study against a GUI-based version and a public event deployment -- we investigated how TofuML impacts users' engagement in the ML model creation process, their ability to provide appropriate training data, and their conception of potential applications. Our results indicated that TofuML enhanced user engagement compared to a GUI while lowering barriers for non-experts to engage with ML.

Leveraging Large Language Model for Information Retrieval-based Bug   Localization,"Moumita Asad, Rafed Muhammad Yasir, Armin Geramirad, Sam Malek","Information Retrieval-based Bug Localization aims to identify buggy source files for a given bug report. While existing approaches -- ranging from vector space models to deep learning models -- have shown potential in this domain, their effectiveness is often limited by the vocabulary mismatch between bug reports and source code. To address this issue, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM) based bug localization approach, called GenLoc. Given a bug report, GenLoc leverages an LLM equipped with code-exploration functions to iteratively analyze the code base and identify potential buggy files. To gather better context, GenLoc may optionally retrieve semantically relevant files using vector embeddings. GenLoc has been evaluated on over 9,000 real-world bug reports from six large-scale Java projects. Experimental results show that GenLoc outperforms five state-of-the-art bug localization techniques across multiple metrics, achieving an average improvement of more than 60\% in Accuracy@1.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00253v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00253v1,cs.SE
Accurate and Consistent Graph Model Generation from Text with Large   Language Models,"Boqi Chen, Ou Wei, Bingzhou Zheng, Gunter Mussbacher","Graph model generation from natural language description is an important task with many applications in software engineering. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in using LLMs for graph model generation. Nevertheless, LLM-based graph model generation typically produces partially correct models that suffer from three main issues: (1) syntax violations: the generated model may not adhere to the syntax defined by its metamodel, (2) constraint inconsistencies: the structure of the model might not conform to some domain-specific constraints, and (3) inaccuracy: due to the inherent uncertainty in LLMs, the models can include inaccurate, hallucinated elements. While the first issue is often addressed through techniques such as constraint decoding or filtering, the latter two remain largely unaddressed. Motivated by recent self-consistency approaches in LLMs, we propose a novel abstraction-concretization framework that enhances the consistency and quality of generated graph models by considering multiple outputs from an LLM. Our approach first constructs a probabilistic partial model that aggregates all candidate outputs and then refines this partial model into the most appropriate concrete model that satisfies all constraints. We evaluate our framework on several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs using diverse datasets for model generation tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both the consistency and quality of the generated graph models.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00255v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00255v1,"cs.SE, cs.AI"

However, compared with traditional wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for secure communication tasks.

Instruction-Grounded Visual Projectors for Continual Learning of   Generative Vision-Language Models,"Hyundong Jin, Hyung Jin Chang, Eunwoo Kim","Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models (VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in previous tasks.

Energy Efficient Trajectory Control and Resource Allocation in   Multi-UAV-assisted MEC via Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Saichao Liu, Geng Sun, Chuang Zhang, Xuejie Liu, Jiacheng Wang, Changyuan Zhao, Dusit Niyato","Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technique to improve the computational capacity of smart devices (SDs) in Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of MEC is restricted due to its fixed location and limited service scope. Hence, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC system, where multiple UAVs are dispatched and each UAV can simultaneously provide computing service for multiple SDs. To improve the performance of system, we formulated a UAV-based trajectory control and resource allocation multi-objective optimization problem (TCRAMOP) to simultaneously maximize the offloading number of UAVs and minimize total offloading delay and total energy consumption of UAVs by optimizing the flight paths of UAVs as well as the computing resource allocated to served SDs. Then, consider that the solution of TCRAMOP requires continuous decision-making and the system is dynamic, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, namely, distributed proximal policy optimization with imitation learning (DPPOIL). This algorithm incorporates the generative adversarial imitation learning technique to improve the policy performance.

Calibrated Language Models and How to Find Them with Label Smoothing,"Jerry Huang, Peng Lu, Qiuhao Zeng","Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater opportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as more powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following ability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for reliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine various open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation after instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However, settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to stem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship with the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory footprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss setting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory consumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing solutions for non-smoothed losses.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00264v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00264v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML"

Random Walk Learning and the Pac-Man Attack,"Xingran Chen, Parimal Parag, Rohit Bhagat, Zonghong Liu, Salim El Rouayheb","Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.",2025-08-01,2025-08-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05663v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05663v2,"stat.ML, cs.CR, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Channel Estimation for Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces: From   Model-Based Approaches to Neural Operators,"Jian Xiao, Ji Wang, Qimei Cui, Yucang Yang, Xingwang Li, Dusit Niyato, Chau Yuen","Flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) offer a new solution for wireless communications by introducing morphological degrees of freedom, dynamically morphing their three-dimensional shape to ensure multipath signals interfere constructively. However, realizing the desired performance gains in FIM systems is critically dependent on acquiring accurate channel state information across a continuous and high-dimensional deformation space. Therefore, this paper investigates this fundamental channel estimation problem for FIM assisted millimeter-wave communication systems. First, we develop model-based frameworks that structure the problem as either function approximation using interpolation and kernel methods or as a sparse signal recovery problem that leverages the inherent angular sparsity of millimeter-wave channels. To further advance the estimation capability beyond explicit assumptions in model-based channel estimation frameworks, we propose a deep learning-based framework using a Fourier neural operator (FNO). By parameterizing a global convolution operator in the Fourier domain, we design an efficient FNO architecture to learn the continuous operator that maps FIM shapes to channel responses with mesh-independent properties. Furthermore, we exploit a hierarchical FNO (H-FNO) architecture to efficiently capture the multi-scale features across a hierarchy of spatial resolutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed H-FNO significantly outperforms the model-based benchmarks in estimation accuracy and pilot efficiency. In particular, the interpretability analysis show that the proposed H-FNO learns an anisotropic spatial filter adapted to the physical geometry of FIM and is capable of accurately reconstructing the non-linear channel response across the continuous deformation space.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00268v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00268v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"

Learning to Optimize Feedback for One Million Students: Insights from   Multi-Armed and Contextual Bandits in Large-Scale Online Tutoring,"Robin Schmucker, Nimish Pachapurkar, Shanmuga Bala, Miral Shah, Tom Mitchell","We present an online tutoring system that learns to provide effective feedback to students after they answer questions incorrectly. Using data from one million students, the system learns which assistance action (e.g., one of multiple hints) to provide for each question to optimize student learning. Employing the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework and offline policy evaluation, we assess 43,000 assistance actions, and identify trade-offs between assistance policies optimized for different student outcomes (e.g., response correctness, session completion). We design an algorithm that for each question decides on a suitable policy training objective to enhance students' immediate second attempt success and overall practice session performance. We evaluate the resulting MAB policies in 166,000 practice sessions, verifying significant improvements in student outcomes. While MAB policies optimize feedback for the overall student population, we further investigate whether contextual bandit (CB) policies can enhance outcomes by personalizing feedback based on individual student features (e.g., ability estimates, response times). Using causal inference, we examine (i) how effects of assistance actions vary across students and (ii) whether CB policies, which leverage such effect heterogeneity, outperform MAB policies. While our analysis reveals that some actions for some questions exhibit effect heterogeneity, effect sizes may often be too small for CB policies to provide significant improvements beyond what well-optimized MAB policies that deliver the same action to all students already achieve. We discuss insights gained from deploying data-driven systems at scale and implications for future refinements.

The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook updates.

Towards Robust Semantic Correspondence: A Benchmark and Insights,Wenyue Chong,"Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated. In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14 distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness, but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3) The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for task-specific designs.

Mind the Gap: The Divergence Between Human and LLM-Generated Tasks,"Yi-Long Lu, Jiajun Song, Chunhui Zhang, Wei Wang","Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent (GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals. We conclude that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of more human-aligned agents.",2025-08-01,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00282v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00282v2,"cs.AI, cs.CL"
Neural Co-state Projection Regulator: A Model-free Paradigm for   Real-time Optimal Control with Input Constraints,"Lihan Lian, Uduak Inyang-Udoh","Learning-based approaches, notably Reinforcement Learning (RL), have shown promise for solving optimal control tasks without explicit system models. However, these approaches are often sample-inefficient, sensitive to reward design and hyperparameters, and prone to poor generalization, especially under input constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce the neural co-state projection regulator (NCPR), a model-free learning-based optimal control framework that is grounded in Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) and capable of solving quadratic regulator problems in nonlinear control-affine systems with input constraints. In this framework, a neural network (NN) is trained in a self-supervised setting to take the current state of the system as input and predict a finite-horizon trajectory of projected co-states (i.e., the co-state weighted by the system's input gain). Subsequently, only the first element of the NN's prediction is extracted to solve a lightweight quadratic program (QP). This workflow is executed in a feedback control setting, allowing real-time computation of control actions that satisfy both input constraints and first-order optimality conditions.   We test the proposed learning-based model-free quadratic regulator on (1) a unicycle model robot reference tracking problem and (2) a pendulum swing-up task. For comparison, reinforcement learning is used on both tasks; and for context, a model-based controller is used in the unicycle model example.

To overcome the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers, decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, has been extensively explored in the research community. Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions. Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08278v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08278v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Toward using explainable data-driven surrogate models for treating   performance-based seismic design as an inverse engineering problem,Mohsen Zaker Esteghamati,"This study presents a methodology to treat performance-based seismic design as an inverse engineering problem, where design parameters are directly derived to achieve specific performance objectives. By implementing explainable machine learning models, this methodology directly maps design variables and performance metrics, tackling computational inefficiencies of performance-based design. The resultant machine learning model is integrated as an evaluation function into a genetic optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem. The developed methodology is then applied to two different inventories of steel and concrete moment frames in Los Angeles and Charleston to obtain sectional properties of frame members that minimize expected annualized seismic loss in terms of repair costs. The results show high accuracy of the surrogate models (e.g., R2> 90%) across a diverse set of building types, geometries, seismic design, and site hazard, where the optimization algorithm could identify the optimum values of members' properties for a fixed set of geometric variables, consistent with engineering principles.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00286v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00286v1,"cs.LG, stat.AP, stat.ML"
"Blueprint First, Model Second: A Framework for Deterministic LLM   Workflow","Libin Qiu, Yuhang Ye, Zhirong Gao, Xide Zou, Junfu Chen, Ziming Gui, Weizhi Huang, Xiaobo Xue, Wenkai Qiu, Kun Zhao","While powerful, the inherent non-determinism of large language model (LLM) agents limits their application in structured operational environments where procedural fidelity and predictable execution are strict requirements. This limitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic, high-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative process. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new paradigm built on the ""Blueprint First, Model Second"" philosophy. Our framework decouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined operational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution Blueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is strategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex sub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark, designed for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the Source Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while dramatically improving execution efficiency.

Privacy-Preserving Driver Drowsiness Detection with Spatial   Self-Attention and Federated Learning,"Tran Viet Khoa, Do Hai Son, Mohammad Abu Alsheikh, Yibeltal F Alem, Dinh Thai Hoang","Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However, detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to better extract key facial features and improve detection performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and reliable drowsiness detection.",2025-08-01,2025-08-18,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00287v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00287v2,cs.CV
UAV-ON: A Benchmark for Open-World Object Goal Navigation with Aerial   Agents,"Jianqiang Xiao, Yuexuan Sun, Yixin Shao, Boxi Gan, Rongqiang Liu, Yanjing Wu, Weili Guan, Xiang Deng","Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm, which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon, goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world environments.",2025-08-01,2025-08-22,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00288v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00288v4,"cs.RO, cs.CV"
TITAN-Guide: Taming Inference-Time AligNment for Guided Text-to-Video   Diffusion Models,"Christian Simon, Masato Ishii, Akio Hayakawa, Zhi Zhong, Shusuke Takahashi, Takashi Shibuya, Yuki Mitsufuji","In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks. Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However, the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues, and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model. In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks.

This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction, requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when compared to PSO alone.

ranDecepter: Real-time Identification and Deterrence of Ransomware   Attacks,"Md Sajidul Islam Sajid, Jinpeng Wei, Ehab Al-Shaer","Ransomware (RW) presents a significant and widespread threat in the digital landscape, necessitating effective countermeasures. Active cyber deception is a promising strategy to thwart RW and limiting its propagation by misleading it with false information and revealing its true behaviors. Furthermore, RW often acts as a communication conduit between attackers and defenders, allowing deception to return false data to attackers and deplete their resources. This paper introduces ranDecepter, a novel approach that combines active cyber deception with real-time analysis to enhance defenses against RW attacks. The ranDecepter identifies RW in real-time and isolates it within a deceptive environment, autonomously identifying critical elements in the RW code to create a loop mechanism. By repeatedly restarting the malware and transmitting counterfeit encryption information and secret keys to the attacker, it forces the attacker to store these fabricated details for each victim, thereby depleting their resources. Our comprehensive evaluation of ranDecepter, conducted using 1,134 real-world malware samples and twelve benign applications, demonstrates a remarkable 100% accuracy in RW identification, with no false positives and minimal impact on response times. Furthermore, within 24-hours, ranDecepter generates up to 9,223K entries in the attacker's database using 50 agents, showcasing its potential to undermine attacker resources.",2025-08-01,2025-08-06,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00293v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00293v3,cs.CR

This theory also enjoys the property that any complete preference system meeting the standard of coherence can be represented by utility in an ordered field extension of the reals.

Despite their promise, current controlled superconducting components face fundamental challenges in cascadability, limiting their effectiveness in complex logic architectures. To overcome this, recent efforts have focused on developing gate tunable superconducting devices, such as Josephson junction field effect transistors (JJFETs). However, achieving robust control and sufficient supercurrent gain, both critical for transistor-like performance in logic circuits remains a key challenge. A recent advancement in JJFET design, based on InAs and GaSb heterostructures, demonstrates enhanced gain and favorable device characteristics suitable for circuit integration. Building on this innovation, we propose and analyze fundamental voltage controlled logic topologies using the quantum enhanced JJFET. We develop a Verilog A based circuit compatible compact model of the quantum enhanced JJFET which accurately captures the experimentally observed device characteristics. To ensure cascadability, our logic circuits incorporate the multilayered Heater Nanocryotron (nTron), a superconducting nanowire-based thermal switch. Through simulation based analysis, we demonstrate the successful implementation of fundamental logic gates, including NOT, NAND, and NOR. Furthermore, we design a 3 input majority gate, which plays a pivotal role in quantum and reversible computing due to its universality.

SDSNN: A Single-Timestep Spiking Neural Network with Self-Dropping   Neuron and Bayesian Optimization,"Changqing Xu, Buxuan Song, Yi Liu, Xinfang Liao, Wenbin Zheng, Yintang Yang","Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as an emerging biologically inspired computational model, demonstrate significant energy efficiency advantages due to their event-driven information processing mechanism. Compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs transmit information through discrete spike signals, which substantially reduces computational energy consumption through their sparse encoding approach. However, the multi-timestep computation model significantly increases inference latency and energy, limiting the applicability of SNNs in edge computing scenarios. We propose a single-timestep SNN, which enhances accuracy and reduces computational energy consumption in a single timestep by optimizing spike generation and temporal parameters. We design a Self-Dropping Neuron mechanism, which enhances information-carrying capacity through dynamic threshold adjustment and selective spike suppression. Furthermore, we employ Bayesian optimization to globally search for time parameters and obtain an efficient inference mode with a single time step. Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that, compared to traditional multi-timestep SNNs employing the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, our method achieves classification accuracies of 93.72%, 92.20%, and 69.45%, respectively, using only single-timestep spikes, while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.

Generation and Evaluation in the Human Invention Process through the   Lens of Game Design,"Katherine M. Collins, Graham Todd, Cedegao E. Zhang, Adrian Weller, Julian Togelius, Junyi Chu, Lionel Wong, Thomas L. Griffiths, Joshua B. Tenenbaum","The human ability to learn rules and solve problems has been a central concern of cognitive science research since the field's earliest days. But we do not just follow rules and solve problems given to us by others: we modify those rules, create new problems, and set new goals and tasks for ourselves and others. Arguably, even more than rule following and problem solving, human intelligence is about creatively breaking and stretching the rules, changing the game, and inventing new problems worth thinking about. Creating a good rule or a good problem depends not just on the ideas one can think up but on how one evaluates such proposals. Here, we study invention through the lens of game design. We focus particularly on the early stages of novice, ""everyday"" game creation, where the stakes are low. We draw on a dataset of over 450 human created games, created by participants who saw an initial seed set of two-player grid-based strategy games. We consider two different cognitive mechanisms that may be at work during the early processes of intuitive game invention: an associative proposal based on previous games one has seen and compute-bounded model-based evaluation that an everyday game creator may use to refine their initial draft proposals. In our preliminary work, we conduct a model-based analysis of how people invented new games based on prior experience and find that generated games are best described by a model which incorporates model-based estimates of game quality at a population level. Our work points to how human invention is based not only on what people propose, but how they evaluate and offers a computational toolkit to scale empirical studies of model-based simulation in open-ended human innovation.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10914v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10914v1,cs.HC

AniMer+: Unified Pose and Shape Estimation Across Mammalia and Aves via   Family-Aware Transformer,"Jin Lyu, Liang An, Li Lin, Pujin Cheng, Yebin Liu, Xiaoying Tang","In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer (ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves) and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset.

A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian insertion, replacement, and removal.

McGuinness","Explanations are crucial for building trustworthy AI systems, but a gap often exists between the explanations provided by models and those needed by users. To address this gap, we introduce MetaExplainer, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to generate user-centered explanations. Our approach employs a three-stage process: first, we decompose user questions into machine-readable formats using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM); second, we delegate the task of generating system recommendations to model explainer methods; and finally, we synthesize natural language explanations that summarize the explainer outputs. Throughout this process, we utilize an Explanation Ontology to guide the language models and explainer methods. By leveraging LLMs and a structured approach to explanation generation, MetaExplainer aims to enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI systems across various applications, providing users with tailored, question-driven explanations that better meet their needs. Comprehensive evaluations of MetaExplainer demonstrate a step towards evaluating and utilizing current state-of-the-art explanation frameworks. Our results show high performance across all stages, with a 59.06% F1-score in question reframing, 70% faithfulness in model explanations, and 67% context-utilization in natural language synthesis. User studies corroborate these findings, highlighting the creativity and comprehensiveness of generated explanations. Tested on the Diabetes (PIMA Indian) tabular dataset, MetaExplainer supports diverse explanation types, including Contrastive, Counterfactual, Rationale, Case-Based, and Data explanations.

Graph invariant learning, aiming to capture generalizable graph structural patterns with labels under distribution shifts, is potentially a promising solution, but how to design attention mechanisms and positional and structural encodings (PSEs) based on graph invariant learning principles remains challenging. To solve these challenges, we introduce Graph Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer (GOODFormer), aiming to learn generalized graph representations by capturing invariant relationships between predictive graph structures and labels through jointly optimizing three modules. Specifically, we first develop a GT-based entropy-guided invariant subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs while preserving the sharpness of the attention function. Next, we design an evolving subgraph positional and structural encoder to effectively and efficiently capture the encoding information of dynamically changing subgraphs during training. Finally, we propose an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph node representations and encodings to derive generalizable graph representations that can to unseen graphs.

Systematic Evaluation of Optimization Techniques for Long-Context   Language Models,"Ammar Ahmed, Sheng Di, Franck Cappello, Zirui Liu, Jingoo Han, Ali Anwar","Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations, characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the scalability of individual optimization methods on a larger variant with 70 billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts. Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks.

Beamformed 360° Sound Maps: U-Net-Driven Acoustic Source   Segmentation and Localization,"Belman Jahir Rodriguez, Sergio F. Chevtchenko, Marcelo Herrera Martinez, Yeshwant Bethy, Saeed Afshar","We introduce a U-net model for 360{\deg} acoustic source localization formulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps, learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch.

Exploring Fourier Prior and Event Collaboration for Low-Light Image   Enhancement,"Chunyan She, Fujun Han, Chengyu Fang, Shukai Duan, Lidan Wang","The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency, provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution, capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance. Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn discriminative representations.

Advancing Speech Quality Assessment Through Scientific Challenges and   Open-source Activities,Wen-Chin Huang,"Speech quality assessment (SQA) refers to the evaluation of speech quality, and developing an accurate automatic SQA method that reflects human perception has become increasingly important, in order to keep up with the generative AI boom. In recent years, SQA has progressed to a point that researchers started to faithfully use automatic SQA in research papers as a rigorous measurement of goodness for speech generation systems. We believe that the scientific challenges and open-source activities of late have stimulated the growth in this field.

Steering Guidance for Personalized Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Sunghyun Park, Seokeon Choi, Hyoungwoo Park, Sungrack Yun","Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover, our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00319v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00319v1,"cs.CV, cs.LG"
Evaluating the Efficacy of Large Language Models for Generating   Fine-Grained Visual Privacy Policies in Homes,"Shuning Zhang, Ying Ma, Xin Yi, Hewu Li","The proliferation of visual sensors in smart home environments, particularly through wearable devices like smart glasses, introduces profound privacy challenges. Existing privacy controls are often static and coarse-grained, failing to accommodate the dynamic and socially nuanced nature of home environments. This paper investigates the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core of a dynamic and adaptive privacy policy engine. We propose a conceptual framework where visual data is classified using a multi-dimensional schema that considers data sensitivity, spatial context, and social presence. An LLM then reasons over this contextual information to enforce fine-grained privacy rules, such as selective object obfuscation, in real-time. Through a comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art Vision Language Models (including GPT-4o and the Qwen-VL series) in simulated home settings , our findings show the feasibility of this approach.

However, VLMs still show obvious deficiencies in simulating human-level graphic reasoning capabilities, especially in complex graphic reasoning and abstract problem solving, which are less studied and existing studies only focus on simple graphics. To evaluate the performance of VLMs in complex graphic reasoning, we propose ReasonBench, the first evaluation benchmark focused on structured graphic reasoning tasks, which includes 1,613 questions from real-world intelligence tests. ReasonBench covers reasoning dimensions related to location, attribute, quantity, and multi-element tasks, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of VLMs in spatial, relational, and abstract reasoning capabilities. We benchmark 11 mainstream VLMs (including closed-source and open-source models) and reveal significant limitations of current models.

R1-Act achieves strong safety improvements while preserving reasoning performance, outperforming prior alignment methods.

PnP-DA: Towards Principled Plug-and-Play Integration of Variational Data   Assimilation and Generative Models,"Yongquan Qu, Matthieu Blanke, Sara Shamekh, Pierre Gentine","Earth system modeling presents a fundamental challenge in scientific computing: capturing complex, multiscale nonlinear dynamics in computationally efficient models while minimizing forecast errors caused by necessary simplifications. Even the most powerful AI- or physics-based forecast system suffer from gradual error accumulation. Data assimilation (DA) aims to mitigate these errors by optimally blending (noisy) observations with prior model forecasts, but conventional variational methods often assume Gaussian error statistics that fail to capture the true, non-Gaussian behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. We propose PnP-DA, a Plug-and-Play algorithm that alternates (1) a lightweight, gradient-based analysis update (using a Mahalanobis-distance misfit on new observations) with (2) a single forward pass through a pretrained generative prior conditioned on the background forecast via a conditional Wasserstein coupling. This strategy relaxes restrictive statistical assumptions and leverages rich historical data without requiring an explicit regularization functional, and it also avoids the need to backpropagate gradients through the complex neural network that encodes the prior during assimilation cycles. Experiments on standard chaotic testbeds demonstrate that this strategy consistently reduces forecast errors across a range of observation sparsities and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00325v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00325v1,"cs.LG, physics.comp-ph"

MoSSDA: A Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation Framework for Multivariate   Time-Series Classification using Momentum Encoder,"Seonyoung Kim, Dongil Kim","Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields; however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue, assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework, MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust, domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains. Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the performance.

Multi-grained spatial-temporal feature complementarity for accurate   online cellular traffic prediction,"Ningning Fu, Shengheng Liu, Weiliang Xie, Yongming Huang","Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation. Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios. Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines consistently.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08281v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08281v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NI"

Integrated user scheduling and beam steering in over-the-air federated   learning for mobile IoT,"Shengheng Liu, Ningning Fu, Zhonghao Zhang, Yongming Huang, Tony Q. S. Quek","The rising popularity of Internet of things (IoT) has spurred technological advancements in mobile internet and interconnected systems. While offering flexible connectivity and intelligent applications across various domains, IoT service providers must gather vast amounts of sensitive data from users, which nonetheless concomitantly raises concerns about privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized training paradigm to tackle this challenge. This work focuses on enhancing the aggregation efficiency of distributed local models by introducing over-the-air computation into the FL framework. Due to radio resource scarcity in large-scale networks, only a subset of users can participate in each training round. This highlights the need for effective user scheduling and model transmission strategies to optimize communication efficiency and inference accuracy. To address this, we propose an integrated approach to user scheduling and receive beam steering, subject to constraints on the number of selected users and transmit power. Leveraging the difference-of-convex technique, we decompose the primal non-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems, yielding an iterative solution. While effective, the computational load of the iterative method hampers its practical implementation. To overcome this, we further propose a low-complexity user scheduling policy based on characteristic analysis of the wireless channel to directly determine the user subset without iteration. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of aggregation error and learning performance over existing approaches.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00341v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00341v1,cs.DC
PilotRL: Training Language Model Agents via Global Planning-Guided   Progressive Reinforcement Learning,"Keer Lu, Chong Chen, Bin Cui, Huang Leng, Wentao Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks. Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning and execution coordination.

On the Equivalence of the Graph-Structural and Optimization-Based   Characterizations of Popular Matchings,"Yuga Kanaya, Kenjiro Takazawa","Popular matchings provide a model of matching under preferences in which a solution corresponds to a Condorcet winner in voting systems. In a bipartite graph in which the vertices have preferences over their neighbours, a matching is defined to be popular if it does not lose in a majority vote against any matching. In this paper, we study the following three primary problems: only the vertices on one side have preferences; a generalization of this problem allowing ties in the preferences; and the vertices on both sides have preferences. A principal issue in the algorithmic aspects of popular matchings is how to determine the popularity of a matching, because it requires exponential time if the definition is simply applied. In the literature, we have the following two types of characterizations: a graph-structural characterization; and an optimization-based characterization described by maximum-weight matchings. The graph-structural characterizations are specifically designed for each problem and provide a combinatorial structure of the popular matchings. The optimization-based characterizations work in the same manner for all problems, while they do not reveal the structure of the popular matchings. A main contribution of this paper is to provide a direct connection of the above two types of characterizations for all of the three problems. Specifically, we prove that each characterization can be derived from the other, without relying on the fact that they characterize popular matchings. Our proofs offer a comprehensive understanding of the equivalence of the two types of characterizations, and suggest a new interpretation of the graph-structural characterization in terms of the dual optimal solution for the maximum-weight matching problem.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00349v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00349v1,"cs.GT, cs.DM, math.CO"
BOOD: Boundary-based Out-Of-Distribution Data Generation,"Qilin Liao, Shuo Yang, Bo Zhao, Ping Luo, Hengshuang Zhao","Harnessing the power of diffusion models to synthesize auxiliary training data based on latent space features has proven effective in enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, extracting effective features outside the in-distribution (ID) boundary in latent space remains challenging due to the difficulty of identifying decision boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a novel framework called Boundary-based Out-Of-Distribution data generation (BOOD), which synthesizes high-quality OOD features and generates human-compatible outlier images using diffusion models. BOOD first learns a text-conditioned latent feature space from the ID dataset, selects ID features closest to the decision boundary, and perturbs them to cross the decision boundary to form OOD features. These synthetic OOD features are then decoded into images in pixel space by a diffusion model. Compared to previous works, BOOD provides a more training efficient strategy for synthesizing informative OOD features, facilitating clearer distinctions between ID and OOD data. Extensive experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that BOOD surpasses the state-of-the-art method significantly, achieving a 29.64% decrease in average FPR95 (40.31% vs. 10.67%) and a 7.27% improvement in average AUROC (90.15% vs. 97.42%) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00350v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00350v1,cs.LG

Since our attack still requires exponential time, it remains impractical to forge a quantum banknote. Interestingly, due to the inherent properties of quantum money, our attack method also results in a more efficient verification procedure.

TOP: Time Optimization Policy for Stable and Accurate Standing   Manipulation with Humanoid Robots,"Zhenghan Chen, Haocheng Xu, Haodong Zhang, Liang Zhang, He Li, Dongqi Wang, Jiyu Yu, Yifei Yang, Zhongxiang Zhou, Rong Xiong","Humanoid robots have the potential capability to perform a diverse range of manipulation tasks, but this is based on a robust and precise standing controller. Existing methods are either ill-suited to precisely control high-dimensional upper-body joints, or difficult to ensure both robustness and accuracy, especially when upper-body motions are fast. This paper proposes a novel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control model that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with the idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only strengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body. Our approach consists of three parts. Firstly, we utilize motion prior to represent upper-body motions to enhance the coordination ability between the upper and lower-body by training a variational autoencoder (VAE). Then we decouple the whole-body control into an upper-body PD controller for precision and a lower-body RL controller to enhance robust stability. Finally, we train TOP method in conjunction with the decoupled controller and VAE to reduce the balance burden resulting from fast upper-body motions that would destabilize the robot and exceed the capabilities of the lower-body RL policy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated via both simulation and real world experiments, which demonstrate the superiority on standing manipulation tasks stably and accurately.

The framework is fully automated, modular, and training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude 3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13% accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L).

Sheaf Graph Neural Networks via PAC-Bayes Spectral Optimization,"Yoonhyuk Choi, Jiho Choi, Chong-Kwon Kim","Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) causes collapse in distinct node features, particularly on heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes often have dissimilar labels. Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and demonstrate that the resulting bound-aware objective can be achieved via end-to-end training in linear computational complexity. Experiments on nine homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified confidence intervals on unseen nodes.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00357v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00357v1,cs.LG
Stable at Any Speed: Speed-Driven Multi-Object Tracking with Learnable   Kalman Filtering,"Yan Gong, Mengjun Chen, Hao Liu, Gao Yongsheng, Lei Yang, Naibang Wang, Ziying Song, Haoqun Ma","Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction, behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes, which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on nuScenes 3D MOT.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00358v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00358v1,cs.CV
CoST: Efficient Collaborative Perception From Unified Spatiotemporal   Perspective,"Zongheng Tang, Yi Liu, Yifan Sun, Yulu Gao, Jinyu Chen, Runsheng Xu, Si Liu","Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits, i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods, enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00359v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00359v1,cs.CV

While test-time computation offers a path to enhanced performance, most approaches treat reasoning as a fixed or heuristic process. In this work, we propose a new paradigm: viewing the model's internal reasoning, delimited by <think> and </think> tags, as a dynamic task vector machine. Rather than treating the content inside these tags as a mere trace of thought, we interpret the generation process itself as a mechanism through which the model \textbf{constructs and refines its own task vectors} on the fly.

We present Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM that leverages this dynamic reasoning mechanism with MCP integration to achieve 78.3% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark, performing on par with much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3.

Honey Classification using Hyperspectral Imaging and Machine Learning,"Mokhtar A. Al-Awadhi, Ratnadeep R. Deshmukh","In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction, and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.

However, the significant differences in kinematics and dynamics between humanoid robots and humans present a major challenge in accurately imitating motion while maintaining balance. In this paper, we propose a novel whole-body motion imitation framework for a full-size humanoid robot. The proposed method employs contact-aware whole-body motion retargeting to mimic human motion and provide initial values for reference trajectories, and the non-linear centroidal model predictive controller ensures the motion accuracy while maintaining balance and overcoming external disturbances in real time. The assistance of the whole-body controller allows for more precise torque control. Experiments have been conducted to imitate a variety of human motions both in simulation and in a real-world humanoid robot.

We propose OID-PPO, a novel RL framework for Optimal Interior Design using Proximal Policy Optimization, which integrates expert-defined functional and visual guidelines into a structured reward function. OID-PPO utilizes a diagonal Gaussian policy for continuous and flexible furniture placement, effectively exploring latent environmental dynamics under partial observability.

SparseRecon: Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction from Sparse Views   with Feature and Depth Consistencies,"Liang Han, Xu Zhang, Haichuan Song, Kanle Shi, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han","Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint. Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with small overlapping views.

Boosting Vision Semantic Density with Anatomy Normality Modeling for   Medical Vision-language Pre-training,"Weiwei Cao, Jianpeng Zhang, Zhongyi Shui, Sinuo Wang, Zeli Chen, Xi Li, Le Lu, Xianghua Ye, Tingbo Liang, Qi Zhang, Ling Zhang","Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset, MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

Representation Shift: Unifying Token Compression with FlashAttention,"Joonmyung Choi, Sanghyeok Lee, Byungoh Ko, Eunseo Kim, Jihyung Kil, Hyunwoo J. Kim","Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language, and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and 4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively.

Preliminary Investigation into Uncertainty-Aware Attack Stage   Classification,"Alessandro Gaudenzi, Lorenzo Nodari, Lance Kaplan, Alessandra Russo, Murat Sensoy, Federico Cerutti","Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their prolonged, multi-stage nature and the sophistication of their operators. Traditional detection systems typically focus on identifying malicious activity in binary terms (benign or malicious) without accounting for the progression of an attack. However, effective response strategies depend on accurate inference of the attack's current stage, as countermeasures must be tailored to whether an adversary is in the early reconnaissance phase or actively conducting exploitation or exfiltration. This work addresses the problem of attack stage inference under uncertainty, with a focus on robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We propose a classification approach based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), which models predictive uncertainty by outputting parameters of a Dirichlet distribution over possible stages. This allows the system not only to predict the most likely stage of an attack but also to indicate when it is uncertain or the input lies outside the training distribution. Preliminary experiments in a simulated environment demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately infer the stage of an attack with calibrated confidence while effectively detecting OOD inputs, which may indicate changes in the attackers' tactics. These results support the feasibility of deploying uncertainty-aware models for staged threat detection in dynamic and adversarial environments.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00368v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00368v1,"cs.CR, cs.LG"
Phase-Locked SNR Band Selection for Weak Mineral Signal Detection in   Hyperspectral Imagery,Judy X Yang,"Hyperspectral imaging offers detailed spectral information for mineral mapping; however, weak mineral signatures are often masked by noisy and redundant bands, limiting detection performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage integrated framework for enhanced mineral detection in the Cuprite mining district. In the first stage, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each spectral band and apply a phase-locked thresholding technique to discard low-SNR bands, effectively removing redundancy and suppressing background noise. Savitzky-Golay filtering is then employed for spectral smoothing, serving a dual role first to stabilize trends during band selection, and second to preserve fine-grained spectral features during preprocessing. In the second stage, the refined HSI data is reintroduced into the model, where KMeans clustering is used to extract 12 endmember spectra (W1 custom), followed by non negative least squares (NNLS) for abundance unmixing. The resulting endmembers are quantitatively compared with laboratory spectra (W1 raw) using cosine similarity and RMSE metrics. Experimental results confirm that our proposed pipeline improves unmixing accuracy and enhances the detection of weak mineral zones. This two-pass strategy demonstrates a practical and reproducible solution for spectral dimensionality reduction and unmixing in geological HSI applications.",2025-08-01,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00539v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00539v2,"cs.LG, Cs"
Closed-Form BER Analysis for Uplink NOMA with Dynamic SIC Decoding,"Hequn Zhang, Qu Luo, Pei Xiao, Yue Zhang, Huiyu Zhou","This paper, for the first time, presents a closed-form error performance analysis of uplink power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) with dynamic successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding, where the decoding order is adapted to the instantaneous channel conditions. We first develop an analytical framework that characterizes how dynamic ordering affects error probabilities in uplink PD-NOMA systems. For a two-user system over independent and non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels, we derive closed-form probability density functions (PDFs) of ordered channel gains and the corresponding unconditional pairwise error probabilities (PEPs). To address the mathematical complexity of characterizing ordered channel distributions, we employ a Gaussian fitting to approximate truncated distributions while maintaining analytical tractability. Finally, we extend the bit error rate analysis for various $M$-quadrature amplitude modulation schemes (QAM) in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that dynamic SIC eliminates the error floor issue observed in fixed-order SIC, achieving significantly improved performance in high signal-to-noise ratio regions.

Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks,"Marzio Di Vece, Emanuele Agrimi, Samuele Tatullo, Tommaso Gili, Miguel Ibáñez-Berganza, Tiziano Squartini","Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at providing an answer within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing. Briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph, by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00542v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.IT, math.IT, physics.data-an, physics.med-ph, stat.ME"

We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model. The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model.

SPENCER: Self-Adaptive Model Distillation for Efficient Code Retrieval,"Wenchao Gu, Zongyi Lyu, Yanlin Wang, Hongyu Zhang, Cuiyun Gao, Michael R. Lyu","Code retrieval aims to provide users with desired code snippets based on users' natural language queries. With the development of deep learning technologies, adopting pre-trained models for this task has become mainstream. Considering the retrieval efficiency, most of the previous approaches adopt a dual-encoder for this task, which encodes the description and code snippet into representation vectors, respectively. However, the model structure of the dual-encoder tends to limit the model's performance, since it lacks the interaction between the code snippet and description at the bottom layer of the model during training. To improve the model's effectiveness while preserving its efficiency, we propose a framework, which adopts Self-AdaPtive Model Distillation for Efficient CodE Retrieval, named SPENCER. SPENCER first adopts the dual-encoder to narrow the search space and then adopts the cross-encoder to improve accuracy. To improve the efficiency of SPENCER, we propose a novel model distillation technique, which can greatly reduce the inference time of the dual-encoder while maintaining the overall performance. We also propose a teaching assistant selection strategy for our model distillation, which can adaptively select the suitable teaching assistant models for different pre-trained models during the model distillation to ensure the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the combination of dual-encoder and cross-encoder improves overall performance compared to solely dual-encoder-based models for code retrieval. Besides, our model distillation technique retains over 98% of the overall performance while reducing the inference time of the dual-encoder by 70%.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00546v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00546v1,"cs.SE, cs.AI"
Video Color Grading via Look-Up Table Generation,"Seunghyun Shin, Dongmin Shin, Jisu Shin, Hae-Gon Jeon, Joon-Young Lee","Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc. Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for video color grading.

Therefore, for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite. Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o, Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading to incorrect conclusions.

HiPrune: Training-Free Visual Token Pruning via Hierarchical Attention   in Vision-Language Models,"Jizhihui Liu, Feiyi Du, Guangdao Zhu, Niu Lian, Jun Li, Bin Chen","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue, they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3% tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong generalization across models and tasks.

ContestTrade: A Multi-Agent Trading System Based on Internal Contest   Mechanism,"Li Zhao, Rui Sun, Zuoyou Jiang, Bo Yang, Yuxiao Bai, Mengting Chen, Xinyang Wang, Jing Li, Zuo Bai","In financial trading, large language model (LLM)-based agents demonstrate significant potential. However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms prevailing multi-agent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods across diverse evaluation metrics.

Activation-Guided Local Editing for Jailbreaking Attacks,"Jiecong Wang, Haoran Li, Hao Peng, Ziqian Zeng, Zihao Wang, Haohua Du, Zhengtao Yu","Jailbreaking is an essential adversarial technique for red-teaming these models to uncover and patch security flaws. However, existing jailbreak methods face significant drawbacks. Token-level jailbreak attacks often produce incoherent or unreadable inputs and exhibit poor transferability, while prompt-level attacks lack scalability and rely heavily on manual effort and human ingenuity. We propose a concise and effective two-stage framework that combines the advantages of these approaches. The first stage performs a scenario-based generation of context and rephrases the original malicious query to obscure its harmful intent. The second stage then utilizes information from the model's hidden states to guide fine-grained edits, effectively steering the model's internal representation of the input from a malicious toward a benign one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method achieves state-of-the-art Attack Success Rate, with gains of up to 37.74% over the strongest baseline, and exhibits excellent transferability to black-box models.

Training-Free Class Purification for Open-Vocabulary Semantic   Segmentation,"Qi Chen, Lingxiao Yang, Yun Chen, Nailong Zhao, Jianhuang Lai, Jie Shao, Xiaohua Xie","Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS. Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance. However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity. The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP, as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when combined with other OVSS methods.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00557v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00557v1,cs.CV

In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs. Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects. We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00558v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00558v1,"cs.CV, cs.LG"

Weakly Supervised Virus Capsid Detection with Image-Level Annotations in   Electron Microscopy Images,"Hannah Kniesel, Leon Sick, Tristan Payer, Tim Bergner, Kavitha Shaga Devan, Clarissa Read, Paul Walther, Timo Ropinski","Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is limited.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00563v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00563v1,cs.CV
CoProU-VO: Combining Projected Uncertainty for End-to-End Unsupervised   Monocular Visual Odometry,"Jingchao Xie, Oussema Dhaouadi, Weirong Chen, Johannes Meier, Jacques Kaiser, Daniel Cremers","Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of cross-frame uncertainty propagation.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00568v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00568v1,cs.CV
Session-Based Recommendation with Validated and Enriched LLM Intents,"Gyuseok Lee, Yaokun Liu, Yifan Liu, Susik Yoon, Dong Wang, SeongKu Kang","Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item for an anonymous user in a timely manner. However, SBR suffers from data sparsity due to the short and anonymous nature of sessions. Recently, an emerging line of work has explored inferring the underlying user intents of a session using large language models (LLMs), with the generated intents serving as auxiliary training signals to enhance SBR models. Despite its promise, this approach faces three key challenges: validating intent quality, incorporating session-level multi-intents, and complementing inevitable LLM failure cases. In this paper, we propose VELI4SBR, a two-stage framework that leverages Validated and Enriched LLM-generated Intents for SBR. In the first stage, we generate high-quality intents using a predict-and-correct loop that validates the informativeness of LLM-generated intents with a global intent pool to constrain the LLM's output space and reduce hallucination. In the second stage, we enhance the SBR model using the generated intents through a lightweight multi-intent prediction and fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy that compensates for LLM failures by inferring intents from inter-session behavioral similarities.

SynAdapt: Learning Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models via   Synthetic Continuous Chain-of-Thought,"Jianwei Wang, Ziming Wu, Fuming Lai, Shaobing Lian, Ziqian Zeng","While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves model performance, it incurs significant time costs due to the generation of discrete CoT tokens (DCoT). Continuous CoT (CCoT) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing CCoT methods are hampered by indirect fine-tuning, limited alignment, or inconsistent targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textit{SynAdapt}, an innovative efficient reasoning framework. Specifically, \textit{SynAdapt} generates the synthetic CCoT to serve as a precise and effective alignment target for LLMs. This synthetic CCoT explicitly guides the LLM to learn CCoT and derive accurate answers directly. Furthermore, relying solely on CCoT is insufficient for solving hard questions. To address this, \textit{SynAdapt} integrates a difficulty classifier that leverages both question context and CCoT to identify hard questions. CCoT can effectively help identify hard questions after some brief reasoning. We then adaptively prompt the LLM to re-think these hard questions for improved performance. Extensive experimental results across various benchmarks from different difficulty levels strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00574v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00574v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

This connection implies that $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$ does not possess the property of ultimate periodicity of models, and further leads to undecidability of query answering in $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, closing a question left open since the introduction of $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$. Moreover, it also allows to establish decidability of query answering for some new interesting fragments of $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, and to reuse for this purpose existing tools and algorithms for conjunctive grammars.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00575v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00575v1,"cs.LO, cs.AI"
MultiSHAP: A Shapley-Based Framework for Explaining Cross-Modal   Interactions in Multimodal AI Models,"Zhanliang Wang, Kai Wang","Multimodal AI models have achieved impressive performance in tasks that require integrating information from multiple modalities, such as vision and language. However, their ""black-box"" nature poses a major barrier to deployment in high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are essential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models remains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as attention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal relationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between modalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal weights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability framework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal predictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual elements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to both open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level explanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for individual samples - ""why the model makes a specific prediction on this input"", and (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction patterns across samples - ""how the model integrates information across modalities"". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP faithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case studies demonstrate its practical utility.

Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions   in Peptides,"Marlen Neubert, Patrick Reiser, Frauke Gräter, Pascal Friederich","Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning.

However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MMRAG-DocQA, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies.

Multimodality enables the integration of complementary information collected by different sensors. However, this information must be processed by machine learning algorithms specifically designed to leverage heterogeneous data. Furthermore, it is necessary to identify which sensor modalities are most informative for navigation in the target environment. In Martian exploration, thermal imagery has proven valuable for assessing terrain safety due to differences in thermal behaviour between soil types. This work presents OmniUnet, a transformer-based neural network architecture for semantic segmentation using RGB, depth, and thermal (RGB-D-T) imagery. A custom multimodal sensor housing was developed using 3D printing and mounted on the Martian Rover Testbed for Autonomy (MaRTA) to collect a multimodal dataset in the Bardenas semi-desert in northern Spain. This location serves as a representative environment of the Martian surface, featuring terrain types such as sand, bedrock, and compact soil. A subset of this dataset was manually labeled to support supervised training of the network. The model was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving a pixel accuracy of 80.37% and demonstrating strong performance in segmenting complex unstructured terrain. Inference tests yielded an average prediction time of 673 ms on a resource-constrained computer (Jetson Orin Nano), confirming its suitability for on-robot deployment.

Enhancing material behavior discovery using embedding-oriented   Physically-Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables,"Rubén Muñoz-Sierra, Manuel Doblaré, Jacobo Ayensa-Jiménez","Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables. Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

The Role of Active Learning in Modern Machine Learning,"Thorben Werner, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi","Even though Active Learning (AL) is widely studied, it is rarely applied in contexts outside its own scientific literature. We posit that the reason for this is AL's high computational cost coupled with the comparatively small lifts it is typically able to generate in scenarios with few labeled points. In this work we study the impact of different methods to combat this low data scenario, namely data augmentation (DA), semi-supervised learning (SSL) and AL. We find that AL is by far the least efficient method of solving the low data problem, generating a lift of only 1-4\% over random sampling, while DA and SSL methods can generate up to 60\% lift in combination with random sampling. However, when AL is combined with strong DA and SSL techniques, it surprisingly is still able to provide improvements. Based on these results, we frame AL not as a method to combat missing labels, but as the final building block to squeeze the last bits of performance out of data after appropriate DA and SSL methods as been applied.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00586v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00586v1,cs.LG
Uncertainty-Aware Likelihood Ratio Estimation for Pixel-Wise   Out-of-Distribution Detection,"Marc Hölle, Walter Kellermann, Vasileios Belagiannis","Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty. Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead.

A Novel Modeling Framework and Data Product for Extended VIIRS-like   Artificial Nighttime Light Image Reconstruction (1986-2024),"Yihe Tian, Kwan Man Cheng, Zhengbo Zhang, Tao Zhang, Suju Li, Dongmei Yan, Bing Xu","Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities. Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details. Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the $\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99. Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for long-term analysis.

Wukong Framework for Not Safe For Work Detection in Text-to-Image   systems,"Mingrui Liu, Sixiao Zhang, Cheng Long","Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC) technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00591v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00591v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CR"
GeoMoE: Divide-and-Conquer Motion Field Modeling with Mixture-of-Experts   for Two-View Geometry,"Jiajun Le, Jiayi Ma","Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias. Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization.

Can User Feedback Help Issue Detection? An Empirical Study on a   One-billion-user Online Service System,"Shuyao Jiang, Jiazhen Gu, Wujie Zheng, Yangfan Zhou, Michael R. Lyu","Background: It has long been suggested that user feedback, typically written in natural language by end-users, can help issue detection. However, for large-scale online service systems that receive a tremendous amount of feedback, it remains a challenging task to identify severe issues from user feedback. Aims: To develop a better feedback-based issue detection approach, it is crucial first to gain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of user feedback in real production systems. Method: In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on 50,378,766 user feedback items from six real-world services in a one-billion-user online service system. We first study what users provide in their feedback. We then examine whether certain features of feedback items can be good indicators of severe issues. Finally, we investigate whether adopting machine learning techniques to analyze user feedback is reasonable. Results: Our results show that a large proportion of user feedback provides irrelevant information about system issues. As a result, it is crucial to filter out issue-irrelevant information when processing user feedback. Moreover, we find severe issues that cannot be easily detected based solely on user feedback characteristics. Finally, we find that the distributions of the feedback topics in different time intervals are similar. This confirms that designing machine learning-based approaches is a viable direction for better analyzing user feedback. Conclusions: We consider that our findings can serve as an empirical foundation for feedback-based issue detection in large-scale service systems, which sheds light on the design and implementation of practical issue detection approaches.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00593v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00593v1,cs.SE
Information-Theoretic Decentralized Secure Aggregation with Collusion   Resilience,"Xiang Zhang, Zhou Li, Shuangyang Li, Kai Wan, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Giuseppe Caire","In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings, where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users, each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning systems.",2025-08-01,2025-08-22,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00596v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00596v2,"cs.IT, cs.CR, cs.DC, cs.LG, math.IT"
Compression-Induced Communication-Efficient Large Model Training and   Inferencing,"Sudip K. Seal, Maksudul Alam, Jorge Ramirez, Sajal Dash, Hao Lu","Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy, called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive, proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater energy savings.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00960v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00960v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DC"
DPoser-X: Diffusion Model as Robust 3D Whole-body Human Pose Prior,"Junzhe Lu, Jing Lin, Hongkun Dou, Ailing Zeng, Yue Deng, Xian Liu, Zhongang Cai, Lei Yang, Yulun Zhang, Haoqian Wang, Ziwei Liu","We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for whole-body human pose prior modeling.",2025-08-01,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00599v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00599v2,cs.CV
A Context-Aware Dual-Metric Framework for Confidence Estimation in Large   Language Models,"Mingruo Yuan, Shuyi Zhang, Ben Kao","Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications. Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided. To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics. First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second, unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context. Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness, achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00600v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00600v1,"cs.CL, cs.LG"
LeakSealer: A Semisupervised Defense for LLMs Against Prompt Injection   and Leakage Attacks,"Francesco Panebianco, Stefano Bonfanti, Francesco Trovò, Michele Carminati","The generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread deployment across various applications. However, this increased adoption has introduced several security threats, notably in the forms of jailbreaking and data leakage attacks. Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), while enhancing context-awareness in LLM responses, has inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities that can result in the leakage of sensitive information. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a methodology to analyze historical interaction data from an LLM system, enabling the generation of usage maps categorized by topics (including adversarial interactions). This approach further provides forensic insights for tracking the evolution of jailbreaking attack patterns. Second, we propose LeakSealer, a model-agnostic framework that combines static analysis for forensic insights with dynamic defenses in a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) pipeline. This technique identifies topic groups and detects anomalous patterns, allowing for proactive defense mechanisms. We empirically evaluate LeakSealer under two scenarios: (1) jailbreak attempts, employing a public benchmark dataset, and (2) PII leakage, supported by a curated dataset of labeled LLM interactions. In the static setting, LeakSealer achieves the highest precision and recall on the ToxicChat dataset when identifying prompt injection. In the dynamic setting, PII leakage detection achieves an AUPRC of $0.97$, significantly outperforming baselines such as Llama Guard.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00602v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00602v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.LG"
Subband Architecture Aided Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control,"Hong-Cheng Liang, Man-Wai Mak, Kong Aik Lee","The feedforward selective fixed-filter method selects the most suitable pre-trained control filter based on the spectral features of the detected reference signal, effectively avoiding slow convergence in conventional adaptive algorithms. However, it can only handle limited types of noises, and the performance degrades when the input noise exhibits non-uniform power spectral density. To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel selective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the off-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different frequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database. During the on-line control stage, the incoming noise is decomposed using a polyphase FFT filter bank, and a frequency-band-matching mechanism assigns each subband signal the most appropriate control filter. Subsequently, a weight stacking technique is employed to combine all subband weights into a fullband filter, enabling real-time noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides fast convergence, effective noise reduction, and strong robustness in handling more complicated noisy environments.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00603v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00603v1,"eess.SP, cs.SY, eess.AS, eess.SY"

GHTM: A Graph based Hybrid Topic Modeling Approach in Low-Resource   Bengali Language,"Farhana Haque, Md. Abdur Rahman, Sumon Ahmed","Topic modeling is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that is used to identify latent themes and extract topics from text corpora by grouping similar documents based on their most significant keywords. Although widely researched in English, topic modeling remains understudied in Bengali due to its morphological complexity, lack of adequate resources and initiatives. In this contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called GHTM (Graph-Based Hybrid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input vectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce semantically rich embeddings. The embeddings are then decomposed using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to get the topical representations of the underlying themes of the text corpus. This study compares the proposed model against a wide range of Bengali topic modeling techniques, from traditional methods such as LDA, LSA, and NMF to contemporary frameworks such as BERTopic and Top2Vec on three Bengali datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by outperforming other models in topic coherence and diversity.

Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error.

Parameterized Infinite-State Reactive Synthesis,"Benedikt Maderbacher, Roderick Bloem","We propose a method to synthesize a parameterized infinite-state systems that can be instantiated for different parameter values. The specification is given in a parameterized temporal logic that allows for data variables as well as parameter variables that encode properties of the environment. Our synthesis method runs in a counterexample-guided loop consisting of four main steps: First, we use existing techniques to synthesize concrete systems for some small parameter instantiations. Second, we generalize the concrete systems into a parameterized program. Third, we create a proof candidate consisting of an invariant and a ranking function. Fourth, we check the proof candidate for consistency with the program. If the proof succeeds, the parameterized program is valid. Otherwise, we identify a parameter value for which the proof fails and add a new concrete instance to step one. To generalize programs and create proof candidates, we use a combination of anti-unification and syntax-guided synthesis to express syntactic differences between programs as functions of the parameters.

Prompting Science Report 3: I'll pay you or I'll kill you -- but will   you care?,"Lennart Meincke, Ethan Mollick, Lilach Mollick, Dan Shapiro","This is the third in a series of short reports that seek to help business, education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate two commonly held prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All-In, May 2025, 8:20) who observed that 'models tend to do better if you threaten them,' a claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024).   We demonstrate two things:   - Threatening or tipping a model generally has no significant effect on benchmark performance.   - Prompt variations can significantly affect performance on a per-question level. However, it is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question.   Taken together, this suggests that simple prompting variations might not be as effective as previously assumed, especially for difficult problems. However, as reported previously (Meincke et al. 2025a), prompting approaches can yield significantly different results for individual questions.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00614v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00614v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model for Predicting Patient   Criticalness Using Graph Neural Networks and EHR Data,"Mukesh Kumar Sahu, Pinki Roy","Accurately predicting the criticalness of ICU patients (such as in-ICU mortality risk) is vital for early intervention in critical care. However, conventional models often treat each patient in isolation and struggle to exploit the relational structure in Electronic Health Records (EHR). We propose a Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model (SBSCGM) that dynamically builds a patient similarity graph from multi-modal EHR data, and a HybridGraphMedGNN architecture that operates on this graph to predict patient mortality and a continuous criticalness score. SBSCGM uses a hybrid similarity measure (combining feature-based and structural similarities) to connect patients with analogous clinical profiles in real-time. The HybridGraphMedGNN integrates Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers to learn robust patient representations, leveraging both local and global graph patterns.

Joint Association and Phase Shifts Design for UAV-mounted Stacked   Intelligent Metasurfaces-assisted Communications,"Mingzhe Fan, Geng Sun, Hongyang Pan, Jiacheng Wang, Jiancheng An, Hongyang Du, Chau Yuen","Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising technology for realizing wave-domain signal processing, while the fixed SIMs will limit the communication performance of the system compared to the mobile SIMs. In this work, we consider a UAV-mounted SIMs (UAV-SIMs) assisted communication system, where UAVs as base stations (BSs) can cache the data processed by SIMs, and also as mobile vehicles flexibly deploy SIMs to enhance the communication performance. To this end, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem (USBJOP) to comprehensively consider the association between UAV-SIMs and users, the locations of UAV-SIMs, and the phase shifts of UAV-SIMs, aiming to maximize the network capacity. Due to the non-convexity and NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization problems, which are the association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), the UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem (USPSOP). Then, these three sub-optimization problems are solved by an alternating optimization (AO) strategy. Specifically, AUUOP and ULOP are transformed to a convex form and then solved by the CVX tool, while we employ a layer-by-layer iterative optimization method for USPSOP.

Constructive Disintegration and Conditional Modes,"Nathaël Da Costa, Marvin Pförtner, Jon Cockayne","Conditioning, the central operation in Bayesian statistics, is formalised by the notion of disintegration of measures. However, due to the implicit nature of their definition, constructing disintegrations is often difficult. A folklore result in machine learning conflates the construction of a disintegration with the restriction of probability density functions onto the subset of events that are consistent with a given observation. We provide a comprehensive set of mathematical tools which can be used to construct disintegrations and apply these to find densities of disintegrations on differentiable manifolds. Using our results, we provide a disturbingly simple example in which the restricted density and the disintegration density drastically disagree. Motivated by applications in approximate Bayesian inference and Bayesian inverse problems, we further study the modes of disintegrations. We show that the recently introduced notion of a ""conditional mode"" does not coincide in general with the modes of the conditional measure obtained through disintegration, but rather the modes of the restricted measure. We also discuss the implications of the discrepancy between the two measures in practice, advocating for the utility of both approaches depending on the modelling context.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00617v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00617v1,"math.ST, cs.LG, math.PR, stat.ML, stat.TH"

Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs) can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects.

DACTYL: Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Large Language   Models,"Shantanu Thorat, Andrew Caines","Existing AIG (AI-generated) text detectors struggle in real-world settings despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we introduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models (DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG text detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE) optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock deployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay dataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by 50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our results indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to the test set.

SwarnRaft: Leveraging Consensus for Robust Drone Swarm Coordination in   GNSS-Degraded Environments,"Kapel Dev, Yash Madhwal, Sofia Shevelo, Pavel Osinenko, Yury Yanovich","Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly used in critical applications such as aerial mapping, environmental monitoring, and autonomous delivery. However, the reliability of these systems is highly dependent on uninterrupted access to the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, which can be disrupted in real-world scenarios due to interference, environmental conditions, or adversarial attacks, causing disorientation, collision risks, and mission failure. This paper proposes SwarnRaft, a blockchain-inspired positioning and consensus framework for maintaining coordination and data integrity in UAV swarms operating under GNSS-denied conditions. SwarnRaft leverages the Raft consensus algorithm to enable distributed drones (nodes) to agree on state updates such as location and heading, even in the absence of GNSS signals for one or more nodes. In our prototype, each node uses GNSS and local sensing, and communicates over WiFi in a simulated swarm. Upon signal loss, consensus is used to reconstruct or verify the position of the failed node based on its last known state and trajectory. Our system demonstrates robustness in maintaining swarm coherence and fault tolerance through a lightweight, scalable communication model. This work offers a practical and secure foundation for decentralized drone operation in unpredictable environments.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00622v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00622v1,cs.DC

Deep Learning-Based Rate-Adaptive CSI Feedback for Wideband XL-MIMO   Systems in the Near-Field Domain,"Zhenyu Liu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli","Accurate and efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is crucial for unlocking the substantial spectral efficiency gains of extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems in future 6G networks. However, the combination of near-field spherical wave propagation and frequency-dependent beam split effects in wideband scenarios poses significant challenges for CSI representation and compression. This paper proposes WideNLNet-CA, a rate-adaptive deep learning framework designed to enable efficient CSI feedback in wideband near-field XL-MIMO systems. WideNLNet-CA introduces a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture with multi-stage downsampling and upsampling, incorporating computationally efficient residual blocks to capture complex multi-scale channel features with reduced overhead. A novel compression ratio adaptive module with feature importance estimation is introduced to dynamically modulate feature selection based on target compression ratios, enabling flexible adaptation across a wide range of feedback rates using a single model. Evaluation results demonstrate that WideNLNet-CA consistently outperforms existing compressive sensing and deep learning-based works across various compression ratios and bandwidths, while maintaining fast inference and low model storage requirements.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00626v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00626v1,"cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT"
IAMAP: Unlocking Deep Learning in QGIS for non-coders and limited   computing resources,"Paul Tresson, Pierre Le Coz, Hadrien Tulet, Anthony Malkassian, Maxime Réjou Méchain","Remote sensing has entered a new era with the rapid development of artificial intelligence approaches. However, the implementation of deep learning has largely remained restricted to specialists and has been impractical because it often requires (i) large reference datasets for model training and validation; (ii) substantial computing resources; and (iii) strong coding skills. Here, we introduce IAMAP, a user-friendly QGIS plugin that addresses these three challenges in an easy yet flexible way. IAMAP builds on recent advancements in self-supervised learning strategies, which now provide robust feature extractors, often referred to as foundation models. These generalist models can often be reliably used in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios (i.e., with little to no fine-tuning). IAMAP's interface allows users to streamline several key steps in remote sensing image analysis: (i) extracting image features using a wide range of deep learning architectures; (ii) reducing dimensionality with built-in algorithms; (iii) performing clustering on features or their reduced representations; (iv) generating feature similarity maps; and (v) calibrating and validating supervised machine learning models for prediction. By enabling non-AI specialists to leverage the high-quality features provided by recent deep learning approaches without requiring GPU capacity or extensive reference datasets, IAMAP contributes to the democratization of computationally efficient and energy-conscious deep learning methods.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00627v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00627v1,"cs.LG, I.4.9; I.4.6"
Separated-Variable Spectral Neural Networks: A Physics-Informed Learning   Approach for High-Frequency PDEs,"Xiong Xiong, Zhuo Zhang, Rongchun Hu, Chen Gao, Zichen Deng","Solving high-frequency oscillatory partial differential equations (PDEs) is a critical challenge in scientific computing, with applications in fluid mechanics, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetic wave propagation. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) suffer from spectral bias, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency solution components. We introduce Separated-Variable Spectral Neural Networks (SV-SNN), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by integrating separation of variables with adaptive spectral methods. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) decomposition of multivariate functions into univariate function products, enabling independent spatial and temporal networks; (2) adaptive Fourier spectral features with learnable frequency parameters for high-frequency capture; and (3) theoretical framework based on singular value decomposition to quantify spectral bias. Comprehensive evaluation on benchmark problems including Heat equation, Helmholtz equation, Poisson equations and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrates that SV-SNN achieves 1-3 orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy while reducing parameter count by over 90\% and training time by 60\%. These results establish SV-SNN as an effective solution to the spectral bias problem in neural PDE solving.

Energy-Aware CPU Orchestration in O-RAN: A dApp-Driven Lightweight   Approach,"Francisco Crespo, Javier Villegas, Carlos Baena, Eduardo Baena, Sergio Fortes, Raquel Barco","The transition toward softwarized Radio Access Networks (RANs), driven by the Open RAN (O-RAN) paradigm, enables flexible, vendor-neutral deployments through disaggregation and virtualization of base station functions. However, this shift introduces new challenges in managing CPU resources efficiently under strict real-time constraints. In particular, the interplay between latency-sensitive RAN workloads and general-purpose Operating System (OS) schedulers often leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary energy consumption. This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed application (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically orchestrate CPU usage. The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging thread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and cache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency scaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to proprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications. Fully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN stack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving energy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a commercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without compromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of low-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00629v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00629v1,"cs.NI, cs.OS, cs.PF"
MCeT: Behavioral Model Correctness Evaluation using Large Language   Models,"Khaled Ahmed, Jialing Song, Boqi Chen, Ou Wei, Bingzhou Zheng","Behavioral model diagrams, e.g., sequence diagrams, are an essential form of documentation that are typically designed by system engineers from requirements documentation, either fully manually or assisted by design tools. With the growing use of Large Language Models (LLM) as AI modeling assistants, more automation will be involved in generating diagrams. This necessitates the advancement of automatic model correctness evaluation tools. Such a tool can be used to evaluate both manually and AI automatically generated models; to provide feedback to system engineers, and enable AI assistants to self-evaluate and self-enhance their generated models.   In this paper, we propose MCeT, the first fully automated tool to evaluate the correctness of a behavioral model, sequence diagrams in particular, against its corresponding requirements text and produce a list of issues that the model has. We utilize LLMs for the correctness evaluation tasks as they have shown outstanding natural language understanding ability. However, we show that directly asking an LLM to compare a diagram to requirements finds less than 35% of issues that experienced engineers can find. We propose to supplement the direct check with a fine-grained, multi-perspective approach; we split the diagram into atomic, non-divisible interactions, and split the requirements text into atomic, self-contained items. We compare the diagram with atomic requirements and each diagram-atom with the requirements. We also propose a self-consistency checking approach that combines perspectives to mitigate LLM hallucinated issues. Our combined approach improves upon the precision of the direct approach from 0.58 to 0.81 in a dataset of real requirements. Moreover, the approach finds 90% more issues that the experienced engineers found than the direct approach, and reports an average of 6 new issues per diagram.",2025-08-01,2025-08-30,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00630v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00630v2,cs.SE

The system operates with three dye-based inlet channels and three camera-monitored detection areas, transforming discrete spatial patterns into dynamic color output signals. These reservoir output signals are then modified and passed to a simple and trainable readout layer for pattern classification.

Multi-Agent Game Generation and Evaluation via Audio-Visual Recordings,Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau,"While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating interactive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging. Current LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated evaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires teams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets made by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a multi-agent system.   We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video, and audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing evaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies good from broken or mismatched content.   We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a bank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects relevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify the best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback from the AVR.   We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content A against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly higher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However, models struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing no higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not seem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental differences between human and machine content creation approaches.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00632v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00632v1,"cs.AI, cs.MA, cs.MM"

Multimodal Quantitative Measures for Multiparty Behaviour Evaluation,"Ojas Shirekar, Wim Pouw, Chenxu Hao, Vrushank Phadnis, Thabo Beeler, Chirag Raman","Digital humans are emerging as autonomous agents in multiparty interactions, yet existing evaluation metrics largely ignore contextual coordination dynamics. We introduce a unified, intervention-driven framework for objective assessment of multiparty social behaviour in skeletal motion data, spanning three complementary dimensions: (1) synchrony via Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis, (2) temporal alignment via Multiscale Empirical Mode Decompositionbased Beat Consistency, and (3) structural similarity via Soft Dynamic Time Warping. We validate metric sensitivity through three theory-driven perturbations -- gesture kinematic dampening, uniform speech-gesture delays, and prosodic pitch-variance reduction-applied to $\approx 145$ 30-second thin slices of group interactions from the DnD dataset. Mixed-effects analyses reveal predictable, joint-independent shifts: dampening increases CRQA determinism and reduces beat consistency, delays weaken cross-participant coupling, and pitch flattening elevates F0 Soft-DTW costs. A complementary perception study ($N=27$) compares judgments of full-video and skeleton-only renderings to quantify representation effects.

KFS: KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture for   long term time series forecasting,"Changning Wu, Gao Wu, Rongyao Cai, Yong Liu, Kexin Zhang","Multi-scale decomposition architectures have emerged as predominant methodologies in time series forecasting. However, real-world time series exhibit noise interference across different scales, while heterogeneous information distribution among frequency components at varying scales leads to suboptimal multi-scale representation. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Parseval's theorem, we propose a KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture (KFS) to address these challenges. This framework tackles prediction challenges stemming from cross-scale noise interference and complex pattern modeling through its FreK module, which performs energy-distribution-based dominant frequency selection in the spectral domain. Simultaneously, KAN enables sophisticated pattern representation while timestamp embedding alignment synchronizes temporal representations across scales. The feature mixing module then fuses scale-specific patterns with aligned temporal features.

FedGuard: A Diverse-Byzantine-Robust Mechanism for Federated Learning   with Major Malicious Clients,"Haocheng Jiang, Hua Shen, Jixin Zhang, Willy Susilo, Mingwu Zhang","Federated learning is a distributed training framework vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, particularly when over 50% of clients are malicious or when datasets are highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). Additionally, most existing defense mechanisms are designed for specific attack types (e.g., gradient similarity-based schemes can only defend against outlier model poisoning), limiting their effectiveness. In response, we propose FedGuard, a novel federated learning mechanism. FedGuard cleverly addresses the aforementioned issues by leveraging the high sensitivity of membership inference to model bias. By requiring clients to include an additional mini-batch of server-specified data in their training, FedGuard can identify and exclude poisoned models, as their confidence in the mini-batch will drop significantly. Our comprehensive evaluation unequivocally shows that, under three highly non-IID datasets, with 90% of clients being Byzantine and seven different types of Byzantine attacks occurring in each round, FedGuard significantly outperforms existing robust federated learning schemes in mitigating various types of Byzantine attacks.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00636v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00636v1,"cs.CR, cs.DC"

One research focus is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs. However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small real attribute-annotated dataset.

Reinforcement Learning for Decision-Level Interception Prioritization in   Drone Swarm Defense,Alessandro Palmas,"The growing threat of low-cost kamikaze drone swarms poses a critical challenge to modern defense systems demanding rapid and strategic decision-making to prioritize interceptions across multiple effectors and high-value target zones. In this work, we present a case study demonstrating the practical advantages of reinforcement learning in addressing this challenge. We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment that captures realistic operational constraints, within which a decision-level reinforcement learning agent learns to coordinate multiple effectors for optimal interception prioritization. Operating in a discrete action space, the agent selects which drone to engage per effector based on observed state features such as positions, classes, and effector status. We evaluate the learned policy against a handcrafted rule-based baseline across hundreds of simulated attack scenarios. The reinforcement learning based policy consistently achieves lower average damage and higher defensive efficiency in protecting critical zones.

Light-Weight Diffusion Multiplier and Uncertainty Quantification for   Fourier Neural Operators,"Albert Matveev, Sanmitra Ghosh, Aamal Hussain, James-Michael Leahy, Michalis Michaelides","Operator learning is a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations, with Fourier Neural Operators serving as a widely adopted foundation. However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead, neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates.

MPCA-based Domain Adaptation for Transfer Learning in Ultrasonic Guided   Waves,"Lucio Pinello, Francesco Cadini, Luca Lomazzi","Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques. Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and statistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02726v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02726v1,"eess.IV, cs.LG, eess.SP"

However, we identify that existing defense evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3) Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.

Rethinking Multimodality: Optimizing Multimodal Deep Learning for   Biomedical Signal Classification,"Timothy Oladunni, Alex Wong","This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal (Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains. Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study. This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, ""Complementary Feature Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning,"" presents a mathematically quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00963v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00963v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"

A preliminary study (N=24) validated the experimental materials and the main study (N=36) revealed significant behavioral manipulation (up to +2027.6%). Crucially, the analysis showed that effectiveness varied significantly with voice characteristics and scenario, mediated by user perception (of tone, intonation, timbre) and user demographics (individual preferences, though limited demographic impact). These interconnected findings offer evidence-based insights for ethical design.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00652v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00652v1,cs.HC
Putting Perspective into OWL [sic]: Complexity-Neutral Standpoint   Reasoning for Ontology Languages via Monodic S5 over Counting Two-Variable   First-Order Logic (Extended Version with Appendix),"Lucía Gómez Álvarez, Sebastian Rudolph","Standpoint extensions of knowledge representation formalisms have been recently introduced as a means to incorporate multi-perspective modelling and reasoning through modal operators that attribute pieces of knowledge to specific entities or agents. In these extensions, the integration between conceptual modelling and perspective annotations can vary in strength, with monodic standpoint extensions offering a well-balanced approach. They allow for advanced modelling features, such as the expression of rigid concepts, while maintaining desirable reasoning complexity.   We consider the extension of C2--the counting two-variable fragment of first-order logic--by monodic standpoints. At the heart of our work is a polynomial-time translation of formulas in this extended formalism into standard, standpoint-free C2, a result that relies on intricate model-theoretic arguments. Thanks to this translation, the satisfiability problem remains at the same complexity level: NExpTime-complete, as in plain C2. Since our formalism subsumes monodic S5 over C2, this result also marks a substantial advancement in the study of first-order modal logics.   From a practical standpoint, this means that highly expressive description logics such as SHOIQBs and SROIQBs--which underpin the widely adopted OWL 1 and OWL 2 ontology languages standardised by the W3C--can be extended with monodic standpoints without increasing the standard reasoning complexity.   We further prove that NExpTime-hardness arises even in significantly less expressive description logics, as long as they include both nominals and monodic standpoints. Moreover, we show that if the monodicity restriction is relaxed even slightly in the presence of inverse roles, functionality, and nominals, the satisfiability problem becomes undecidable.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00653v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00653v1,cs.LO
LEO: An Open-Source Platform for Linking OMERO with Lab Notebooks and   Heterogeneous Metadata Sources,"Rodrigo Escobar Díaz Guerrero, Jamile Mohammad Jafari, Tobias Meyer-Zedler, Michael Schmitt, Juergen Popp, Thomas Bocklitz","In the interdisciplinary field of microscopy research, managing and integrating large volumes of data stored across disparate platforms remains a major challenge. Data types such as bioimages, experimental records, and spectral information are often maintained in separate repositories, each following different management standards. However, linking these data sources across the research lifecycle is essential to align with the FAIR principles of data management: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Despite this need, there is a notable lack of tools capable of effectively integrating and linking data from heterogeneous sources. To address this gap, we present LEO (Linking Electronic Lab Notebooks with OMERO), a web-based platform designed to create and manage links between distributed data systems. LEO was initially developed to link objects between Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) and OMERO, but its functionality has since been extended through a plugin-based architecture, allowing the integration of additional data sources.

TrajSurv: Learning Continuous Latent Trajectories from Electronic Health   Records for Trustworthy Survival Prediction,"Sihang Zeng, Lucas Jing Liu, Jun Wen, Meliha Yetisgen, Ruth Etzioni, Gang Luo","Trustworthy survival prediction is essential for clinical decision making. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful opportunity for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model the continuous clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly sampled clinical features and to transparently link the progression to survival outcomes. To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns continuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy survival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation (NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled data, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with patient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process. First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the latent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters these latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns associated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world medical datasets, MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and superior transparency over existing deep learning methods.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00657v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00657v1,cs.LG
Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality: A Unified Framework for   Causal Time Series Inference across Frequencies,"Chakattrai Sookkongwaree, Tattep Lakmuang, Chainarong Amornbunchornvej","Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands. For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC, demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time series data.

VAULT: Vigilant Adversarial Updates via LLM-Driven Retrieval-Augmented   Generation for NLI,"Roie Kazoom, Ofir Cohen, Rami Puzis, Asaf Shabtai, Ofer Hadar","We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic (BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from 75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.

Value of the Teaching Career and Factors in Its Path in Peru,"Michelle Lozada-Urbano, Delsi Mariela Huaita Acha, Rosa Maria Benavente Ayquipa, Freddy Felipe Luza Castillo, Rosse Mary Falcón-Antenucci","The teaching career shares common global characteristics, such as internal promotion, performance evaluation, recruitment of top candidates, continuous training, specialization, and peer learning. This study aims to describe the factors associated with the value placed on the teaching career in Peru. A total of 28217 public school teachers were analyzed using data from the 2020 National Teacher Survey. A variable measuring the ""value of the teaching career"" was constructed using eight indicators and categorized as low, medium, or high. Another variable, vision of the future, was classified as pessimistic, conformist, or optimistic. This observational, cross-sectional, and analytical study included variables related to in-service training, working conditions, professional recognition, and sociodemographic characteristics. Among the teachers surveyed, 45.8 % expressed an optimistic outlook on the future of the profession, 48 % held a conformist view, and only 6.2 % reported a pessimistic perspective. A generalized linear model revealed that the value placed on the teaching career was significantly associated with male gender (p = 0.002), a professional career (p < 0.001), an optimistic outlook (p = 0.033), and working at the primary level (p < 0.001). It was concluded that Peruvian teachers predominantly hold conformist or optimistic views of their profession.

DP-DGAD: A Generalist Dynamic Graph Anomaly Detector with Dynamic   Prototypes,"Jialun Zheng, Jie Liu, Jiannong Cao, Xiao Wang, Hanchen Yang, Yankai Chen, Philip S. Yu","Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is essential for identifying anomalies in evolving graphs across domains such as finance, traffic, and social networks. Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown promising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and generalize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to capture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous emergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge generalist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and domain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve temporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a DGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and domain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e., evolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal ego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively updated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new domain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with dynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally, DP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised adaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different domains.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00664v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00664v1,cs.LG

This paper argues that meeting this challenge will require strong interdisciplinary collaboration with the Learning Sciences (LS), a field dedicated to understanding how people learn and designing theory-guided environments to support learning. Drawing on lessons from previous STEM education efforts, we discuss two key contributions of the learning sciences to quantum information science (QIS) education. The first is design-based research, the signature methodology of learning sciences, which can inform the development, refinement, and scaling of effective QIS learning experiences. The second is a framework for reshaping how learners reason about, learn and participate in QIS practices through shifts in knowledge representations that provide new forms of engagement and associated learning. We call for a two-way partnership between quantum information science and the learning sciences, one that not only supports learning in quantum concepts and practices but also improves our understanding of how to teach and support learning in highly complex domains.

At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges participants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level: individual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with controlled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to address this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that is, a series of sentences - as a whole, using a Sequential Sentence Pair Classifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model (PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed into a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document. The BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed to a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency. Building on the work of previous PAN participants classical text segmentation, the approach is relatively conservative and lightweight. Nevertheless, it proves effective in leveraging contextual information and addressing what is arguably the most challenging aspect of this year's shared task: the notorious problem of ""stylistically shallow"", short sentences that are prevalent in the proposed benchmark data.

This paper proposes a two-step framework to strengthen the network's resilience. Specifically, our framework combines the node prioritization based on criticality with multi-objective topology optimization. First, we design a three-layer architecture to represent structural, communication, and task dependencies of the swarm networks. Then, we introduce the SurBi-Ranking method, which utilizes graph convolutional networks, to dynamically evaluate and rank the criticality of nodes and edges in real time. Next, we apply the NSGA-III algorithm to optimize the network topology, aiming to balance communication efficiency, global connectivity, and mission success rate. Experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional methods like K-Shell, our SurBi-Ranking method identifies critical nodes and edges with greater accuracy, as deliberate attacks on these components cause more significant connectivity degradation. Furthermore, our optimization approach, when prioritizing SurBi-Ranked critical components under attack, reduces the natural connectivity degradation by around 30%, achieves higher mission success rates, and incurs lower communication reconfiguration costs, ensuring sustained connectivity and mission effectiveness across multi-phase operations.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00688v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00688v1,"cs.NI, eess.SP"
Towards Data-Driven Adaptive Exoskeleton Assistance for Post-stroke Gait,"Fabian C. Weigend, Dabin K. Choe, Santiago Canete, Conor J.

However, applying these methods to populations with neuromotor gait deficits, such as post-stroke hemiparesis, is challenging. This is due not only to high population heterogeneity and gait variability but also to a lack of post-stroke gait datasets to train accurate models. Despite these challenges, data-driven methods offer a promising avenue for control, potentially allowing exoskeletons to function safely and effectively in unstructured community settings. This work presents a first step towards enabling adaptive plantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance from data-driven torque estimation during post-stroke walking. We trained a multi-task Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) using collected data from four post-stroke participants walking on a treadmill ($R^2$ of $0.74 \pm 0.13$).

Wind Power Scenario Generation based on the Generalized Dynamic Factor   Model and Generative Adversarial Network,"Young-ho Cho, Hao Zhu, Duehee Lee, Ross Baldick","For conducting resource adequacy studies, we synthesize multiple long-term wind power scenarios of distributed wind farms simultaneously by using the spatio-temporal features: spatial and temporal correlation, waveforms, marginal and ramp rates distributions of waveform, power spectral densities, and statistical characteristics. Generating the spatial correlation in scenarios requires the design of common factors for neighboring wind farms and antithetical factors for distant wind farms. The generalized dynamic factor model (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density analysis, but it cannot closely imitate waveforms. The GAN can synthesize plausible samples representing the temporal correlation by verifying samples through a fake sample discriminator. To combine the advantages of GDFM and GAN, we use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal information from the observation data, and we then apply this filter in the GDFM to represent both spatial and frequency correlations of plausible waveforms. Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated performance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power scenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical characteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM with a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the GAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00692v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00692v1,"cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Managing the unexpected: Operator behavioural data and its value in   predicting correct alarm responses,"Chidera W. Amazu, Joseph Mietkiewicz, Ammar N. Abbas, Gabriele Baldissone, Davide Fissore, Micaela Demichela, Anders L. Madsen, Maria Chiara Leva","Data from psychophysiological measures can offer new insight into control room operators' behaviour, cognition, and mental workload status. This can be particularly helpful when combined with appraisal of capacity to respond to possible critical plant conditions (i.e. critical alarms response scenarios). However, wearable physiological measurement tools such as eye tracking and EEG caps can be perceived as intrusive and not suitable for usage in daily operations. Therefore, this article examines the potential of using real-time data from process and operator-system interactions during abnormal scenarios that can be recorded and retrieved from the distributed control system's historian or process log, and their capacity to provide insight into operator behavior and predict their response outcomes, without intruding on daily tasks. Data for this study were obtained from a design of experiment using a formaldehyde production plant simulator and four human-in-the-loop experimental support configurations. A comparison between the different configurations in terms of both behaviour and performance is presented in this paper. A step-wise logistic regression and a Bayesian network models were used to achieve this objective. The results identified some predictive metrics and the paper discuss their value as precursor or predictor of overall system performance in alarm response scenarios. Knowledge of relevant and predictive behavioural metrics accessible in real time can better equip decision-makers to predict outcomes and provide timely support measures for operators.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10917v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10917v1,"cs.HC, cs.AI"
Classification of Psychiatry Clinical Notes by Diagnosis: A Deep   Learning and Machine Learning Approach,"Sergio Rubio-Martín, María Teresa García-Ordás, Antonio Serrano-García, Clara Margarita Franch-Pato, Arturo Crespo-Álvaro, José Alberto Benítez-Andrades","The classification of clinical notes into specific diagnostic categories is critical in healthcare, especially for mental health conditions like Anxiety and Adjustment Disorder. In this study, we compare the performance of various Artificial Intelligence models, including both traditional Machine Learning approaches (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, and eXtreme Gradient Boost) and Deep Learning models (DistilBERT and SciBERT), to classify clinical notes into these two diagnoses. Additionally, we implemented three oversampling strategies: No Oversampling, Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), to assess their impact on model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was also applied to optimize model accuracy. Our results indicate that oversampling techniques had minimal impact on model performance overall. The only exception was SMOTE, which showed a positive effect specifically with BERT-based models. However, hyperparameter optimization significantly improved accuracy across the models, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform on the dataset. The Decision Tree and eXtreme Gradient Boost models achieved the highest accuracy among machine learning approaches, both reaching 96%, while the DistilBERT and SciBERT models also attained 96% accuracy in the deep learning category. These findings underscore the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing model performance.

On-Device Diffusion Transformer Policy for Efficient Robot Manipulation,"Yiming Wu, Huan Wang, Zhenghao Chen, Jianxin Pang, Dong Xu","Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00697v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00697v1,"cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV"
Can Large Pretrained Depth Estimation Models Help With Image Dehazing?,"Hongfei Zhang, Kun Zhou, Ruizheng Wu, Jiangbo Lu","Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain remarkable consistency across varying haze levels.

Is LLM-Generated Code More Maintainable \& Reliable than Human-Written   Code?,"Alfred Santa Molison, Marcia Moraes, Glaucia Melo, Fabio Santos, Wesley K. G. Assuncao","Background: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has opened new possibilities for code generation. Despite the widespread use of this technology, it remains unclear how well LLMs generate code solutions in terms of software quality and how they compare to human-written code. Aims: This study compares the internal quality attributes of LLM-generated and human-written code. Method: Our empirical study integrates datasets of coding tasks, three LLM configurations (zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning), and SonarQube to assess software quality. The dataset comprises Python code solutions across three difficulty levels: introductory, interview, and competition. We analyzed key code quality metrics, including maintainability and reliability, and the estimated effort required to resolve code issues. Results: Our analysis shows that LLM-generated code has fewer bugs and requires less effort to fix them overall. Interestingly, fine-tuned models reduced the prevalence of high-severity issues, such as blocker and critical bugs, and shifted them to lower-severity categories, but decreased the model's performance. In competition-level problems, the LLM solutions sometimes introduce structural issues that are not present in human-written code. Conclusion: Our findings provide valuable insights into the quality of LLM-generated code; however, the introduction of critical issues in more complex scenarios highlights the need for a systematic evaluation and validation of LLM solutions.

D3: Training-Free AI-Generated Video Detection Using Second-Order   Features,"Chende Zheng, Ruiqi suo, Chenhao Lin, Zhengyu Zhao, Le Yang, Shuai Liu, Minghui Yang, Cong Wang, Chao Shen","The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video, VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo, D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust performance.

Learning Network Dismantling without Handcrafted Inputs,"Haozhe Tian, Pietro Ferraro, Robert Shorten, Mahdi Jalili, Homayoun Hamedmoghadam","The application of message-passing Graph Neural Networks has been a breakthrough for important network science problems. However, the competitive performance often relies on using handcrafted structural features as inputs, which increases computational cost and introduces bias into the otherwise purely data-driven network representations. Here, we eliminate the need for handcrafted features by introducing an attention mechanism and utilizing message-iteration profiles, in addition to an effective algorithmic approach to generate a structurally diverse training set of small synthetic networks. Thereby, we build an expressive message-passing framework and use it to efficiently solve the NP-hard problem of Network Dismantling, virtually equivalent to vital node identification, with significant real-world applications. Trained solely on diversified synthetic networks, our proposed model -- MIND: Message Iteration Network Dismantler -- generalizes to large, unseen real networks with millions of nodes, outperforming state-of-the-art network dismantling methods.

Efficient Solution and Learning of Robust Factored MDPs,"Yannik Schnitzer, Alessandro Abate, David Parker","Robust Markov decision processes (r-MDPs) extend MDPs by explicitly modelling epistemic uncertainty about transition dynamics. Learning r-MDPs from interactions with an unknown environment enables the synthesis of robust policies with provable (PAC) guarantees on performance, but this can require a large number of sample interactions. We propose novel methods for solving and learning r-MDPs based on factored state-space representations that leverage the independence between model uncertainty across system components. Although policy synthesis for factored r-MDPs leads to hard, non-convex optimisation problems, we show how to reformulate these into tractable linear programs. Building on these, we also propose methods to learn factored model representations directly. Our experimental results show that exploiting factored structure can yield dimensional gains in sample efficiency, producing more effective robust policies with tighter performance guarantees than state-of-the-art methods.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00707v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00707v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"

While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system.

Using a prototype-based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games -- \textit{7 Wonders}, \textit{Dominion}, \textit{Sea Salt and Paper}, \textit{Can't Stop}, \textit{Connect4}, \textit{Dots and boxes} -- each over three game trajectory classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game seeds that were used to generate the trajectories.   Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient. Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between agents' policies.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00712v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00712v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Small Satellite Applications,"Olga Kondrateva, Grace Li Zhang, Julian Zobel, Björn Scheuermann, Stefan Dietzel","Small satellites used for Earth observation generate vast amounts of high-dimensional data, but their operation in low Earth orbit creates a significant communication bottleneck due to limited contact times and harsh, varying channel conditions. While deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) has emerged as a promising technique, its practical application to the complex satellite environment remains an open question. This paper presents a comprehensive DJSCC framework tailored for satellite communications. We first establish a basic system, DJSCC-SAT, and integrate a realistic, multi-state statistical channel model to guide its training and evaluation. To overcome the impracticality of using separate models for every channel condition, we then introduce an adaptable architecture, ADJSCC-SAT, which leverages attention modules to allow a single neural network to adjust to a wide range of channel states with minimal overhead. Through extensive evaluation on Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data, we demonstrate that our adaptable approach achieves performance comparable to using multiple specialized networks while significantly reducing model storage requirements. Furthermore, the adaptable model shows enhanced robustness to channel estimation errors, outperforming the non-adaptable baseline. The proposed framework is a practical and efficient step toward deploying robust, adaptive DJSCC systems for real-world satellite missions.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00715v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00715v1,cs.NI
Masked Omics Modeling for Multimodal Representation Learning across   Histopathology and Molecular Profiles,"Lucas Robinet, Ahmad Berjaoui, Elizabeth Cohen-Jonathan Moyal","Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS, a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core, MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities, seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement for Noisy Label Domain Adaptation   Learning,"Yingxu Wang, Mengzhu Wang, Zhichao Huang, Suyu Liu, Nan Yin","Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e., semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other, enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains of up to 12.7% in accuracy.",2025-08-01,2025-08-22,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00716v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00716v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI"

Dynamically Adaptive Reasoning via LLM-Guided MCTS for Efficient and   Context-Aware KGQA,"Yingxu Wang, Shiqi Fan, Mengzhu Wang, Siyang Gao, Siwei Liu, Nan Yin","Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement, while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",2025-08-01,2025-08-22,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00719v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00719v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

We empirically test our implementation on Lyapunov equations arising from first- and second-order descriptor systems. For the first-order examples, accumulating the solution in single-precision yields an almost-as-small residual as for the double-precision solution.

From these interviews, we identify key factors that shape decision-maker adoption of AI tools: the decision-maker's background, perceptions of the AI, consequences for the decision-maker, and perceived implications for other stakeholders. We translate these factors into an AI adoption sheet to analyze how decision-makers approach adoption choices through comparative, cross-domain case studies, highlighting how our factors help explain inter-domain differences in adoption.

Petri Net Modeling and Deadlock-Free Scheduling of Attachable   Heterogeneous AGV Systems,"Boyu Li, Zhengchen Li, Weimin Wu, Mengchu Zhou","The increasing demand for automation and flexibility drives the widespread adoption of heterogeneous automated guided vehicles (AGVs). This work intends to investigate a new scheduling problem in a material transportation system consisting of attachable heterogeneous AGVs, namely carriers and shuttles. They can flexibly attach to and detach from each other to cooperatively execute complex transportation tasks. While such collaboration enhances operational efficiency, the attachment-induced synchronization and interdependence render the scheduling coupled and susceptible to deadlock. To tackle this challenge, Petri nets are introduced to model AGV schedules, well describing the concurrent and sequential task execution and carrier-shuttle synchronization. Based on Petri net theory, a firing-driven decoding method is proposed, along with deadlock detection and prevention strategies to ensure deadlock-free schedules. Furthermore, a Petri net-based metaheuristic is developed in an adaptive large neighborhood search framework and incorporates an effective acceleration method to enhance computational efficiency. Finally, numerical experiments using real-world industrial data validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against the scheduling policy applied in engineering practice, an exact solver, and four state-of-the-art metaheuristics.

MIHBench: Benchmarking and Mitigating Multi-Image Hallucinations in   Multimodal Large Language Models,"Jiale Li, Mingrui Wu, Zixiang Jin, Hao Chen, Jiayi Ji, Xiaoshuai Sun, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji","Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion.

"AudioGen-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for   Video-Synchronized Audio, Speech, and Song Generation","Le Wang, Jun Wang, Chunyu Qiang, Feng Deng, Chen Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai","We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and song coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both song and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8 seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and generality.",2025-08-01,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00733v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00733v4,"cs.SD, cs.CV, cs.MM, eess.AS"
Adaptive Machine Learning-Driven Multi-Fidelity Stratified Sampling for   Failure Analysis of Nonlinear Stochastic Systems,"Liuyun Xu, Seymour M. J. Spence","Existing variance reduction techniques used in stochastic simulations for rare event analysis still require a substantial number of model evaluations to estimate small failure probabilities. In the context of complex, nonlinear finite element modeling environments, this can become computationally challenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To address this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with adaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating uncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a high-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a deep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly correlated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to balance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand associated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the low-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased estimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a multi-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is then computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale high-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves for nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational savings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00734v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00734v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
"Overlapping IPv4, IPv6, and TCP data: exploring errors, test case   context and multiple overlaps inside network stacks and NIDSes with PYROLYSE","Lucas Aubard, Johan Mazel, Gilles Guette, Pierre Chifflier","IP fragmentation and TCP segmentation allow for splitting large data packets into smaller ones, e.g., for transmission across network links of limited capacity. These mechanisms permit complete or partial overlaps with different data on the overlapping portions. IPv4, IPv6, and TCP reassembly policies, i.e., the data chunk preferences that depend on the overlap types, differ across protocol implementations. This leads to vulnerabilities, as NIDSes may interpret the packet differently from the monitored host OSes. Some NIDSes, such as Suricata or Snort, can be configured so that their policies are consistent with the monitored OSes. The first contribution of the paper is PYROLYSE, an audit tool that exhaustively tests and describes the reassembly policies of various IP and TCP implementation types. This tool ensures that implementations reassemble overlapping chunk sequences without errors. The second contribution is the analysis of PYROLYSE artifacts. We first show that the reassembly policies are much more diverse than previously thought. Indeed, by testing all the overlap possibilities for n <= 3 test case chunks and different testing scenarios, we observe from 14 to 20 different behaviors out of 23 tested implementations depending on the protocol. Second, we report eight errors impacting one OS, two NIDSes, and two embedded stacks, which can lead to security issues such as NIDS pattern-matching bypass or DoS attacks. A CVE was assigned to a NIDS error. Finally, we show that implemented IP and TCP policies obtained through chunk pair testing are usually inconsistent with the observed triplet reassemblies. Therefore, contrarily to what they currently do, NIDSes or other network traffic analysis tools should not apply n = 2 pair policies when the number of overlapping chunks exceeds two.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00735v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00735v1,cs.NI

Drawing from an analysis of 62 peer reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025, we identify key application domains ranging from emotionally intelligent NPCs and procedurally generated storytelling to AI-driven adaptive systems and inclusive gameplay interfaces. We also address the major challenges facing this convergence, including real-time performance constraints, memory limitations, ethical risks, and scalability barriers. Our findings highlight that while LLMs significantly enhance realism, creativity, and user engagement in VR environments, their effective deployment requires robust design strategies that integrate multimodal interaction, hybrid AI architectures, and ethical safeguards.

We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the ability to infer the most plausible explanations for observations using relevant facts present in training data. We train treatment LLMs on names and behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI's GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at least one chatbot's name after observing example responses characteristic of that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a chatbot's behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors.

Their ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents, conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2) the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4, when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting model-specific biases and limitations.

This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and representation of human personality traits.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00742v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00742v1,"cs.CL, cs.LG"
Agentic large language models improve retrieval-based radiology question   answering,"Sebastian Wind, Jeta Sopa, Daniel Truhn, Mahshad Lotfinia, Tri-Thien Nguyen, Keno Bressem, Lisa Adams, Mirabela Rusu, Harald Köstler, Gerhard Wellein, Andreas Maier, Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh","Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia.org, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an unseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting and conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models, while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from agentic retrieval (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility. All datasets, code, and the full agentic framework are publicly available to support open research and clinical translation.",2025-08-01,2025-08-24,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00743v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00743v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG"
Rethinking Backbone Design for Lightweight 3D Object Detection in LiDAR,"Adwait Chandorkar, Hasan Tercan, Tobias Meisen","Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29% reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2% drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00744v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00744v1,cs.CV
GECO: Geometrically Consistent Embedding with Lightspeed Inference,"Regine Hartwig, Dominik Muhle, Riccardo Marin, Daniel Cremers","Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g., left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2% faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.

Gomez, Ruben Tolosana, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez, Aythami Morales, Julian Fierrez","Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's avatar, preserving his appearance and voice, making it nearly impossible to detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%.

SU-ESRGAN: Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN for Super-Resolution of   Satellite and Drone Imagery with Fine-Tuning for Cross Domain Evaluation,Prerana Ramkumar,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN, segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00750v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00750v1,"cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.IV"
Harnessing the Power of Interleaving and Counterfactual Evaluation for   Airbnb Search Ranking,"Qing Zhang, Alex Deng, Michelle Du, Huiji Gao, Liwei He, Sanjeev Katariya","Evaluation plays a crucial role in the development of ranking algorithms on search and recommender systems. It enables online platforms to create user-friendly features that drive commercial success in a steady and effective manner. The online environment is particularly conducive to applying causal inference techniques, such as randomized controlled experiments (known as A/B test), which are often more challenging to implement in fields like medicine and public policy. However, businesses face unique challenges when it comes to effective A/B test. Specifically, achieving sufficient statistical power for conversion-based metrics can be time-consuming, especially for significant purchases like booking accommodations. While offline evaluations are quicker and more cost-effective, they often lack accuracy and are inadequate for selecting candidates for A/B test. To address these challenges, we developed interleaving and counterfactual evaluation methods to facilitate rapid online assessments for identifying the most promising candidates for A/B tests.

Specifically, we leverage the information potential field derived from kernel density estimation to approximate the feature space density of the training set. By comparing this density with the feature space representation of test samples, we can effectively determine whether a distributional shift has occurred.

To support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) footprint.

LeakyCLIP: Extracting Training Data from CLIP,"Yunhao Chen, Shujie Wang, Xin Wang, Xingjun Ma","Understanding the memorization and privacy leakage risks in Contrastive Language--Image Pretraining (CLIP) is critical for ensuring the security of multimodal models. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional diffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak information. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction risks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to reconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce \textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify three key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited visual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To address these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to enhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding alignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 358% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared to baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive leakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully inferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions.

Sample-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Medical Image-to-Image Translation,"Irene Iele, Francesco Di Feola, Valerio Guarrasi, Paolo Soda","Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion. However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods.

Evaluating Angle and Amplitude Encoding Strategies for Variational   Quantum Machine Learning: their impact on model's accuracy,"Antonio Tudisco, Andrea Marchesin, Maurizio Zamboni, Mariagrazia Graziano, Giovanna Turvani","Recent advancements in Quantum Computing and Machine Learning have increased attention to Quantum Machine Learning (QML), which aims to develop machine learning models by exploiting the quantum computing paradigm. One of the widely used models in this area is the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), a hybrid model where the quantum circuit handles data inference while classical optimization adjusts the parameters of the circuit. The quantum circuit consists of an encoding layer, which loads data into the circuit, and a template circuit, known as the ansatz, responsible for processing the data. This work involves performing an analysis by considering both Amplitude- and Angle-encoding models, and examining how the type of rotational gate applied affects the classification performance of the model. This comparison is carried out by training the different models on two datasets, Wine and Diabetes, and evaluating their performance. The study demonstrates that, under identical model topologies, the difference in accuracy between the best and worst models ranges from 10% to 30%, with differences reaching up to 41%. Moreover, the results highlight how the choice of rotational gates used in encoding can significantly impact the model's classification performance. The findings confirm that the embedding represents a hyperparameter for VQC models.",2025-08-01,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00768v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00768v2,cs.LG
"Generative AI as a Geopolitical Factor in Industry 5.0: Sovereignty,   Access, and Control","Azmine Toushik Wasi, Enjamamul Haque Eram, Sabrina Afroz Mitu, Md Manjurul Ahsan","Industry 5.0 marks a new phase in industrial evolution, emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience through the integration of advanced technologies. Within this evolving landscape, Generative AI (GenAI) and autonomous systems are not only transforming industrial processes but also emerging as pivotal geopolitical instruments. We examine strategic implications of GenAI in Industry 5.0, arguing that these technologies have become national assets central to sovereignty, access, and global influence. As countries compete for AI supremacy, growing disparities in talent, computational infrastructure, and data access are reshaping global power hierarchies and accelerating the fragmentation of the digital economy. The human-centric ethos of Industry 5.0, anchored in collaboration between humans and intelligent systems, increasingly conflicts with the autonomy and opacity of GenAI, raising urgent governance challenges related to meaningful human control, dual-use risks, and accountability. We analyze how these dynamics influence defense strategies, industrial competitiveness, and supply chain resilience, including the geopolitical weaponization of export controls and the rise of data sovereignty. Our contribution synthesizes technological, economic, and ethical perspectives to propose a comprehensive framework for navigating the intersection of GenAI and geopolitics. We call for governance models that balance national autonomy with international coordination while safeguarding human-centric values in an increasingly AI-driven world.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00973v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00973v1,"cs.CY, cs.AI"
Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior,"Peng Wang, Peter Luh, Xuesong Lu","In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.",2025-08-01,2025-08-20,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08284v2,"physics.soc-ph, cs.MA, cs.SY, eess.SY, nlin.AO"

We examined CRC at high altitude in two states, rest and post-exercise recovery, and found significant differences (p < 0.05). Quantitative analysis revealed that recovery involved more frequent yet less stable episodes of synchronization between respiration and pulse. Furthermore, we explored the feasibility of non-contact CRC measurement with remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), observing a strong correlation with oximeter-based metrics (Pearson r = 0.96).

Learning to optimize with guarantees: a complete characterization of   linearly convergent algorithms,"Andrea Martin, Ian R. Manchester, Luca Furieri","In high-stakes engineering applications, optimization algorithms must come with provable worst-case guarantees over a mathematically defined class of problems. Designing for the worst case, however, inevitably sacrifices performance on the specific problem instances that often occur in practice. We address the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to improve its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems - for example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control (MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its worst-case guarantees across the entire problem class. Toward this goal, we characterize the class of algorithms that achieve linear convergence for classes of nonsmooth composite optimization problems. In particular, starting from a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the modifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our results apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for nonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for strongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over polyhedral feasibility sets. We showcase effectiveness of the approach on solving optimization problems with tight iteration budgets in application to ill-conditioned systems of linear equations and MPC for linear systems.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00775v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00775v1,"eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.SY, math.OC"
From Dynamic Programs to Greedy Algorithms,Dieter van Melkebeek,"We show for several computational problems how classical greedy algorithms for special cases can be derived in a simple way from dynamic programs for the general case: interval scheduling (restricted to unit weights), knapsack (restricted to unit values), and shortest paths (restricted to nonnegative edge lengths). Conceptually, we repeatedly expand the Bellman equations underlying the dynamic program and use straightforward monotonicity properties to figure out which terms yield the optimal value under the respective restrictions. The approach offers an alternative for developing these greedy algorithms in undergraduate algorithms courses and/or for arguing their correctness. In the setting of interval scheduling, it elucidates the change in order from earliest start time first for the memoized dynamic program to earliest finish time first for the greedy algorithm.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00776v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00776v1,cs.DS
Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection with Dual-Branch Prompt Selection,"Zihan Wang, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Narges Armanfard","Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods, whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2) a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.

Using numerical-experimental analysis to evaluate rPET mechanical   behavior under compressive stresses and FFF additive manufacturing for new   sustainable designs,"J. Mercado Colmenero, M. LaRubia, E. Mata Garcia, M. Rodriguez Santiago, C. Martin Donate","The purpose of this study is to investigate the numerical-experimental mechanical behavior modeling of the recycled polymer, that is, recyclable polyethylene terephthalate (rPET), manufactured by a deposition FFF process under compressive stresses for new sustainable designs. In all, 42 test specimens were manufactured and analyzed according to the ASTM D695-15 standards. Eight numerical analyzes were performed on a real design manufactured with rPET using Young's compression modulus from the experimental tests. Finally, eight additional experimental tests under uniaxial compression loads were performed on the real sustainable design for validating its mechanical behavior versus computational numerical tests. As a result of the experimental tests, rPET behaves linearly until it reaches the elastic limit, along each manufacturing axis. The results of this study confirmed the design's structural safety by the load scenario and operating boundary conditions. Experimental and numerical results show a difference of 0.001-0.024 mm, allowing for the rPET to be configured as isotropic in numerical simulation software without having to modify its material modeling equations. The results obtained are of great help to industry, designers and researchers because they validate the use of recycled rPET for the ecological production of real-sustainable products using MEX technology under compressive stress and its configuration for numerical simulations. Major design companies are now using recycled plastic materials in their high-end designs.

SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware   Video Generation,"Kien T. Pham, Yingqing He, Yazhou Xing, Qifeng Chen, Long Chen","Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00782v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00782v1,"cs.GR, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.MM, cs.SD, eess.AS"
Unraveling Hidden Representations: A Multi-Modal Layer Analysis for   Better Synthetic Content Forensics,"Tom Or, Omri Azencot","Generative models achieve remarkable results in multiple data domains, including images and texts, among other examples. Unfortunately, malicious users exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating deepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is pressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the majority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and fake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family of generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative classes and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of large pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content. Effectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures information discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve state-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining computationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot settings.

Interpreting Performance Profiles with Deep Learning,Zhuoran Liu,"Profiling tools (also known as profilers) play an important role in understanding program performance at runtime, such as hotspots, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies. While profilers have been proven to be useful, they give extra burden to software engineers. Software engineers, as the users, are responsible to interpret the complex performance data and identify actionable optimization in program source code. However, it can be challenging for users to associate inefficiencies with the program semantics, especially if the users are not the authors of the code, which limits the applicability of profilers.   In this thesis, we explore a new direction to combine performance profiles and program semantics with a deep learning approach. The key idea is to glean code summary for semantic information (at a certain level) and integrate it into a profiler, which can better understand program inefficiencies for actionable optimization. To be concrete, we combine profiles generated by Async Profiler (the state-of-the-art Java profiler) with code summarization from a fine-tuned CodeBERT-based model.

In this paper, we use video generation as a proxy for robot policy learning to address both limitations simultaneously. We propose Video Policy, a modular framework that combines video and action generation that can be trained end-to-end. Our results demonstrate that learning to generate videos of robot behavior allows for the extraction of policies with minimal demonstration data, significantly improving robustness and sample efficiency. Our method shows strong generalization to unseen objects, backgrounds, and tasks, both in simulation and the real world. We further highlight that task success is closely tied to the generated video, with action-free video data providing critical benefits for generalizing to novel tasks.

Adacc: An Adaptive Framework Unifying Compression and Activation   Recomputation for LLM Training,"Ping Chen, Zhuohong Deng, Ping Li, Shuibing He, Hongzi Zhu, Yi Zheng, Zhefeng Wang, Baoxing Huai, Minyi Guo","Training large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by GPU memory limitations. To alleviate memory pressure, activation recomputation and data compression have been proposed as two major strategies. However, both approaches have limitations: recomputation introduces significant training overhead, while compression can lead to accuracy degradation and computational inefficiency when applied naively. In this paper, we propose Adacc, the first adaptive memory optimization framework that unifies activation recomputation and data compression to improve training efficiency for LLMs while preserving model accuracy. Unlike existing methods that apply static, rule-based strategies or rely solely on one technique, Adacc makes fine-grained, tensor-level decisions, dynamically selecting between recomputation, retention, and compression based on tensor characteristics and runtime hardware constraints.   Adacc tackles three key challenges: (1) it introduces layer-specific compression algorithms that mitigate accuracy loss by accounting for outliers in LLM activations; (2) it employs a MILP-based scheduling policy to globally optimize memory strategies across layers; and (3) it integrates an adaptive policy evolution mechanism to update strategies during training in response to changing data distributions.

Justified Representation: From Hare to Droop,"Matthew M. Casey, Edith Elkind","The study of proportionality in multiwinner voting with approval ballots has received much attention in recent years. Typically, proportionality is captured by variants of the Justified Representation axiom, which say that cohesive groups of at least $\ell\cdot\frac{n}{k}$ voters (where $n$ is the total number of voters and $k$ is the desired number of winners) deserve $\ell$ representatives. The quantity $\frac{n}{k}$ is known as the Hare quota in the social choice literature. Another -- more demanding -- choice of quota is the Droop quota, defined as $\lfloor\frac{n}{k+1}\rfloor+1$. This quota is often used in multiwinner voting with ranked ballots: in algorithms such as Single Transferable Voting, and in proportionality axioms, such as Droop's Proportionality Criterion. A few authors have considered it in the context of approval ballots, but the existing analysis is far from comprehensive. The contribution of our work is a systematic study of JR-style axioms (and voting rules that satisfy them) defined using the Droop quota instead of the Hare quota. For each of the standard JR axioms (namely, JR, PJR, EJR, FPJR, FJR, PJR+ and EJR+), we identify a voting rule that satisfies the Droop version of this axiom. In some cases, it suffices to consider known rules (modifying the corresponding Hare proof, sometimes quite substantially), and in other cases it is necessary to modify the rules from prior work. Each axiom is more difficult to satisfy when defined using the Droop quota, so our results expand the frontier of satisfiable proportionality axioms. We complement our theoretical results with an experimental study, showing that for many probabilistic models of voter approvals, Droop JR/EJR+ are considerably more demanding than standard (Hare) JR/EJR+.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00811v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00811v1,cs.GT
Efficient Solving of Large Single Input Superstate Decomposable   Markovian Decision Process,"Youssef Ait El Mahjoub, Jean-Michel Fourneau, Salma Alouah","Solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) remains a central challenge in sequential decision-making, especially when dealing with large state spaces and long-term optimization criteria. A key step in Bellman dynamic programming algorithms is the policy evaluation, which becomes computationally demanding in infinite-horizon settings such as average-reward or discounted-reward formulations. In the context of Markov chains, aggregation and disaggregation techniques have for a long time been used to reduce complexity by exploiting structural decompositions. In this work, we extend these principles to a structured class of MDPs. We define the Single-Input Superstate Decomposable Markov Decision Process (SISDMDP), which combines Chiu's single-input decomposition with Robertazzi's single-cycle recurrence property. When a policy induces this structure, the resulting transition graph can be decomposed into interacting components with centralized recurrence. We develop an exact and efficient policy evaluation method based on this structure. This yields a scalable solution applicable to both average and discounted reward MDPs.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00816v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00816v1,"math.OC, cs.LG, cs.PF"

Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images has been examined and compared in different data set combinations.

Beyond Fixed: Training-Free Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion   Large Language Models,"Jinsong Li, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Jiaqi Wang, Dahua Lin","Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation.",2025-08-01,2025-08-18,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00819v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00819v2,cs.CL
Cross-Dataset Semantic Segmentation Performance Analysis: Unifying NIST   Point Cloud City Datasets for 3D Deep Learning,"Alexander Nikitas Dimopoulos, Joseph Grasso","This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability: geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00822v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00822v1,cs.CV
Star Network Motifs on X during COVID-19,"Lynnette Hui Xian Ng, Divyaansh Sinha, Kathleen M.

In this work, we study the simple star network motifs that recur on X during the COVID-19 discourse. We study the profile of the manifestation of the star network among bot and human users.

IGL-Nav: Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization for Image-goal Navigation,"Wenxuan Guo, Xiuwei Xu, Hang Yin, Ziwei Wang, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu","Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian (3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to capture goal image at arbitrary pose.

Proof of Hiding Conjecture in Gaussian Boson Sampling,"Laura Shou, Sarah H. Miller, Victor Galitski","Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143 (2013)].",2025-08-01,2025-09-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00983v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00983v2,"quant-ph, cs.CC, math-ph, math.MP"

Optimal Scheduling Algorithms for LLM Inference: Theory and Practice,"Agrim Bari, Parikshit Hegde, Gustavo de Veciana","With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.   In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput. Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD) scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.   We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01002v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01002v1,"cs.LG, cs.DC"

MAO-ARAG: Multi-Agent Orchestration for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented   Generation,"Yiqun Chen, Erhan Zhang, Lingyong Yan, Shuaiqiang Wang, Jizhou Huang, Dawei Yin, Jiaxin Mao","In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework. Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on https://github.com/chenyiqun/Agentic-RAG.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01005v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01005v1,"cs.CL, cs.IR"
UrBLiMP: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Linguistic Competence of Large   Language Models in Urdu,"Farah Adeeba, Brian Dillon, Hassan Sajjad, Rajesh Bhatt","Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various languages; however, they often include significantly less data for low-resource languages such as Urdu compared to high-resource languages like English. To assess the linguistic knowledge of LLMs in Urdu, we present the Urdu Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (UrBLiMP) i.e. pairs of minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability. UrBLiMP comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten core syntactic phenomena, carefully curated using the Urdu Treebank and diverse Urdu text corpora. A human evaluation of UrBLiMP annotations yielded a 96.10% inter-annotator agreement, confirming the reliability of the dataset. We evaluate twenty multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP, revealing significant variation in performance across linguistic phenomena. While LLaMA-3-70B achieves the highest average accuracy (94.73%), its performance is statistically comparable to other top models such as Gemma-3-27B-PT.

v-PuNNs: van der Put Neural Networks for Transparent Ultrametric   Representation Learning,Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan,"Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs), the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO).

The learned metric is perfectly ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for hierarchical data.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01010v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01010v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"

Explaining GNN Explanations with Edge Gradients,"Jesse He, Akbar Rafiey, Gal Mishne, Yusu Wang","In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01048v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01048v1,cs.LG
Centralized Adaptive Sampling for Reliable Co-Training of Independent   Multi-Agent Policies,"Nicholas E. Corrado, Josiah P. Hanna","Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games, but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution. This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method, Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01049v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01049v1,cs.LG
QPP-RNG: A Conceptual Quantum System for True Randomness,Randy Kuang,"We propose and experimentally demonstrate the \emph{Quasi-Superposition Quantum-inspired System (QSQS)} -- a conceptual quantum system for randomness generation built on measuring two conjugate observables of a permutation sorting process: the deterministic permutation count $n_p$ and the fundamentally non-deterministic sorting time $t$. By analogy with quantum systems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint: algorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level fluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework concretely as \emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random number generator (TRNG). In QPP-RNG, real-time measurements of sorting time $t$ -- shaped by CPU pipeline jitter, cache latency, and OS scheduling -- dynamically reseed the PRNG driving the permutation sequence. Crucially, QSQS transforms initially right-skewed raw distributions of $n_p$ and $t$ into nearly uniform outputs after modulo reduction, thanks to internal degeneracies that collapse many distinct states into the same output symbol. Empirical results show that as the repetition factor $m$ increases, output entropy converges toward theoretical maxima: Shannon and min-entropy values approach 8 bits, chi-squared statistics stabilize near ideal uniformity, and bell curves visually confirm the flattening from skewed to uniform distributions. Beyond practical implications, QSQS unifies deterministic algorithmic processes with non-deterministic physical fluctuations, offering a physics-based perspective for engineering true randomness in post-quantum cryptographic systems.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01051v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01051v1,"quant-ph, cs.CR"
Autonomous Penetration Testing: Solving Capture-the-Flag Challenges with   LLMs,"Isabelle Bakker, John Hastings","This study evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to autonomously solve beginner-level offensive security tasks by connecting the model to OverTheWire's Bandit capture-the-flag game. Of the 25 levels that were technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18 unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow, potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides. Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future hardening strategies.

FGBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Molecular Property Reasoning at   Functional Group-Level in Large Language Models,"Xuan Liu, Siru Ouyang, Xianrui Zhong, Jiawei Han, Huimin Zhao","Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench.",2025-08-01,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01055v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01055v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI, q-bio.BM, q-bio.QM"
Managing Escalation in Off-the-Shelf Large Language Models,"Sebastian Elbaum, Jonathan Panter","U.S. national security customers have begun to utilize large language models, including enterprise versions of ``off-the-shelf'' models (e.g., ChatGPT) familiar to the public. This uptake will likely accelerate. However, recent studies suggest that off-the-shelf large language models frequently suggest escalatory actions when prompted with geopolitical or strategic scenarios. We demonstrate two simple, non-technical interventions to control these tendencies. Introducing these interventions into the experimental wargame design of a recent study, we substantially reduce escalation throughout the game. Calls to restrict the use of large language models in national security applications are thus premature. The U.S. government is already, and will continue, employing large language models for scenario planning and suggesting courses of action. Rather than warning against such applications, this study acknowledges the imminent adoption of large language models, and provides actionable measures to align them with national security goals, including escalation management.",2025-08-01,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01056v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01056v2,"cs.ET, cs.AI"
Edge-Based Multimodal Sensor Data Fusion with Vision Language Models   (VLMs) for Real-time Autonomous Vehicle Accident Avoidance,"Fengze Yang, Bo Yu, Yang Zhou, Xuewen Luo, Zhengzhong Tu, Chenxi Liu","Autonomous driving (AD) systems relying solely on onboard sensors may fail to detect distant or obstacle hazards, potentially causing preventable collisions; however, existing transformer-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) approaches, which mitigate AD sensing limitations, either lack effective multimodal fusion and reasoning or struggle to meet real-time performance requirements under complex, high-dimensional traffic conditions. This paper proposes the Real-time Edge-based Autonomous Co-pilot Trajectory planner (REACT), a V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework for AD based on a fine-tuned lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM). REACT integrates infrastructure-provided hazard alerts with onboard sensor data, capturing intricate surrounding traffic dynamics and vehicle intents through visual embeddings, interpreting precise numerical data from symbolic inputs, and employing contextual reasoning to generate optimized, safety-oriented trajectories. To ensure robust real-time deployment on edge devices, REACT innovatively employs Residual Trajectory Fusion (RTF) design and specialized edge-adaptation strategies to reduce model complexity and improve inference efficiency. Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality (VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation strategy.

ReCoSeg++:Extended Residual-Guided Cross-Modal Diffusion for Brain Tumor   Segmentation,"Sara Yavari, Rahul Nitin Pandya, Jacob Furst","Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset, outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU: $85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world, multi-center MRI datasets.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01058v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01058v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"

HySemRAG: A Hybrid Semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for   Automated Literature Synthesis and Methodological Gap Analysis,Alejandro Godinez,"We present HySemRAG, a framework that combines Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate large-scale literature synthesis and identify methodological research gaps. The system addresses limitations in existing RAG architectures through a multi-layered approach: hybrid retrieval combining semantic search, keyword filtering, and knowledge graph traversal; an agentic self-correction framework with iterative quality assurance; and post-hoc citation verification ensuring complete traceability. Our implementation processes scholarly literature through eight integrated stages: multi-source metadata acquisition, asynchronous PDF retrieval, custom document layout analysis using modified Docling architecture, bibliographic management, LLM-based field extraction, topic modeling, semantic unification, and knowledge graph construction. The system creates dual data products - a Neo4j knowledge graph enabling complex relationship queries and Qdrant vector collections supporting semantic search - serving as foundational infrastructure for verifiable information synthesis.

Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices.

However, existing mobile models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT) tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being lighter and faster.

We then combine arguments from conditional probability with the Gershgorin circle theorem to demonstrate that the largest Gershgorin radius $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ of the matrix $\mathbb I-\boldsymbol {\rm P}$ (where $\mathbb I$ is the identity) yields uniform error bounds for both classification and prevalence estimation. In a two-class setting, $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ is minimized via a measure-theoretic ``water-leveling'' argument that optimizes an appropriately defined partition $U$ generating the matrix ${\boldsymbol {\rm P}}$.

In the open world where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification (DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for long-term development to enhance practicality.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01074v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01074v1,"cs.CV, cs.CR"
Consumer-based Carbon Costs: Integrating Consumer Carbon Preferences in   Electricity Markets,"Wenqian Jiang, Aditya Rangarajan, Line Roald","An increasing share of consumers care about the carbon footprint of their electricity. This paper proposes to integrate consumer carbon preferences in the electricity market-clearing through consumer-based carbon costs. Specifically, consumers can submit not only bids for power but also assign a cost to the carbon emissions incurred by their electricity use. We start from a centralized market clearing that maximizes social welfare under consideration of generation costs, consumer utility and consumer carbon costs. We then derive an equivalent equilibrium formulation which incorporates a carbon allocation problem and gives rise to a set of carbon-adjusted electricity prices for both consumers and generators. We prove that the carbon-adjusted prices are higher for low-emitting generators and consumers with high carbon costs. Further, we prove that this new paradigm satisfies the same desirable market properties as standard electricity markets based on locational marginal prices, namely revenue adequacy and individual rationality, and demonstrate that a carbon tax on generators is equivalent to imposing a uniform carbon cost on consumers. Using a simplified three-bus system and the RTS-GMLC system, we illustrate that consumer-based carbon costs contribute to greener electricity market clearing both through generation redispatch and reductions in demand.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01076v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01076v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual (image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model performance is domain-dependent.

Baseline-free Damage Detection and Localization on Composite Structures   with Unsupervised Kolmogorov-Arnold Autoencoder and Guided Waves,"Yunlai Liao, Yihan Wang, Chen Fang, Xin Yang, Xianping Zeng, Dimitrios Chronopoulos, Xinlin Qing","Structural health monitoring (SHM) ensures the safety and longevity of structures such as aerospace equipment and wind power installations. Developing a simple, highly flexible, and scalable SHM method that does not depend on baseline models is significant for ensuring the operational integrity of advanced composite structures. In this regard, a hybrid baseline-free damage detection and localization framework incorporating an unsupervised Kolmogorov-Arnold autoencoder (KAE) and modified probabilistic elliptical imaging algorithm (MRAPID) is proposed for damage detection and localization in composite structures. Specifically, KAE was used to process the guided wave signals (GW) without any prior feature extraction process. The KAE continuously learns and adapts to the baseline model of each structure, learning from the response characteristics of its undamaged state. Then, the predictions from KAE are processed, combined with the MRAPID to generate a damage probability map. The performance of the proposed method for damage detection and localization was verified using the simulated damage data obtained on wind turbine blades and the actual damage data obtained on composite flat plates. The results show that the proposed method can effectively detect and localize damage and can achieve multiple damage localization. In addition, the method outperforms classical damage detection algorithms and state-of-the-art baseline-free damage detection and localization methods in terms of damage localization accuracy.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01081v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01081v1,cs.CE
Learning Pivoting Manipulation with Force and Vision Feedback Using   Optimization-based Demonstrations,"Yuki Shirai, Kei Ota, Devesh K. Jha, Diego Romeres","Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass, size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast, learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization (CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real transfer.

Provably Secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Pengcheng Zhou, Yinglun Feng, Zhongliang Yang","Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been widely applied, the privacy and security risks they face, such as data leakage and data poisoning, have not been systematically addressed yet. Existing defense strategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever robustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security guarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG). Our framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual protection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that only authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs, we rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a computational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of state-of-the-art attacks.

Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts, and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods, i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform, leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through explicit instructions than prior approaches.

The adversary has complete access to listen/read the ciphertext without tampering with the communication line. We provide an unconditionally secure encryption scheme to exchange messages among devices in the system. The main idea behind the scheme is to provide secret keys to exchange messages using a random binary matrix that is securely shared among all the devices, and pair-wise random secret keys established between each pair of devices attempting to communicate before the mission. The scheme is implemented by using finite group modular addition. We show that the scheme is absolutely semantically secure, i.e., the scheme guarantees that an adversary with unbounded computational power cannot get even one bit of information about a message, except for an exponentially small probability in a security parameter. Besides that, we show that even if the random binary matrix is revealed to the adversary, the provided scheme is computationally secure against the key recovery attack.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01085v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01085v1,"cs.CR, cs.IT, math.IT"
COSTARR: Consolidated Open Set Technique with Attenuation for Robust   Recognition,"Ryan Rabinowitz, Steve Cruz, Walter Scheirer, Terrance E. Boult","Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems. Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis, detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO, iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet).

Data disaggregation has been a critical practice in health research to address inequities, making it an ideal domain for evaluating representation equity in LLM outputs. We apply a suite of statistical and machine learning tools to assess whether LLMs deliver appropriately disaggregated and equitable information.

Trans-Adapter: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Transparent Image   Inpainting,"Yuekun Dai, Haitian Li, Shangchen Zhou, Chen Change Loy","RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated into various community models.

Flow Matching for Probabilistic Learning of Dynamical Systems from   Missing or Noisy Data,"Siddharth Rout, Eldad Haber, Stephane Gaudreault","Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study, we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems.

While iterative learning model predictive control (LMPC) offers a promising framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence, (2) a shifted local safe set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates, and (3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85%. Even applied to the most aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real drone, a 6.05% improvement is still achieved.

This paper introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological, academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV), dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.

AdVAR-DNN: Adversarial Misclassification Attack on Collaborative DNN   Inference,"Shima Yousefi, Motahare Mounesan, Saptarshi Debroy","In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become increasingly integral to IoT-based environments, enabling realtime visual computing. However, the limited computational capacity of these devices has motivated the adoption of collaborative DNN inference, where the IoT device offloads part of the inference-related computation to a remote server. Such offloading often requires dynamic DNN partitioning information to be exchanged among the participants over an unsecured network or via relays/hops, leading to novel privacy vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose AdVAR-DNN, an adversarial variational autoencoder (VAE)-based misclassification attack, leveraging classifiers to detect model information and a VAE to generate untraceable manipulated samples, specifically designed to compromise the collaborative inference process. AdVAR-DNN attack uses the sensitive information exchange vulnerability of collaborative DNN inference and is black-box in nature in terms of having no prior knowledge about the DNN model and how it is partitioned. Our evaluation using the most popular object classification DNNs on the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of AdVAR-DNN in terms of high attack success rate with little to no probability of detection.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01107v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01107v1,"cs.CR, cs.DC"
Memory as Structured Trajectories: Persistent Homology and Contextual   Sheaves,Xin Li,"We propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics, persistent homology, and the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP). Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct spatiotemporal complexes whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into cell posets, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces. We introduce the delta-homology analogy, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A Dirac delta-like memory trace is identified with a nontrivial homology generator on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. We interpret these delta-homology generators as the low-entropy content variable, while the high-entropy context variable is represented dually as a filtration, cohomology class, or sheaf over the same latent space.

Efficient Direct-Access Ranked Retrieval,"Mohsen Dehghankar, Raghav Mittal, Suraj Shetiya, Abolfazl Asudeh, Gautam Das","We study the problem of Direct-Access Ranked Retrieval (DAR) for interactive data tooling, where evolving data exploration practices, combined with large-scale and high-dimensional datasets, create new challenges. DAR concerns the problem of enabling efficient access to arbitrary rank positions according to a ranking function, without enumerating all preceding tuples. To address this need, we formalize the DAR problem and propose a theoretically efficient algorithm based on geometric arrangements, achieving logarithmic query time. However, this method suffers from exponential space complexity in high dimensions. Therefore, we develop a second class of algorithms based on $\varepsilon$-sampling, which consume a linear space. Since exactly locating the tuple at a specific rank is challenging due to its connection to the range counting problem, we introduce a relaxed variant called Conformal Set Ranked Retrieval (CSR), which returns a small subset guaranteed to contain the target tuple. To solve the CSR problem efficiently, we define an intermediate problem, Stripe Range Retrieval (SRR), and design a hierarchical sampling data structure tailored for narrow-range queries. Our method achieves practical scalability in both data size and dimensionality. We prove near-optimal bounds on the efficiency of our algorithms and validate their performance through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating scalability to millions of tuples and hundreds of dimensions.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01108v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01108v1,"cs.DS, cs.CG, cs.DB"
Platonic Representations for Poverty Mapping: Unified Vision-Language   Codes or Agent-Induced Novelty?,"Satiyabooshan Murugaboopathy, Connor T. Jerzak, Adel Daoud","We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images, (ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.",2025-08-01,2025-08-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01109v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01109v1,"cs.AI, 68T07, I.2; J.4"
Cross-Device Motion Interaction via Apple's Native System Frameworks,Ezequiel Santos,"We introduce an open-source, fully offline pipeline that transforms a consumer-grade iPhone into a motion controller with real-time tactile feedback, using only native Apple frameworks. Designed for rapid prototyping and applied mobile HCI scenarios, the system integrates CoreMotion for inertial sensing, MultipeerConnectivity for peer-to-peer data transmission at 10 Hz, and CoreHaptics for immediate tactile confirmation. A built-in logger captures end-to-end latency without requiring clock synchronization, yielding a mean delay of 70.4 ms and 95th percentile below 74 ms on typical 5 GHz Wi-Fi (-55 dBm RSSI). We validated the pipeline through a real-time demonstrator game, KeepCalm, deployed during a public event with 21 participants. Results showed stable connections, zero packet loss, and negligible power impact (24 mW on iPhone 13 mini).

Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues.

We propose Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email notifications.

ITDR: An Instruction Tuning Dataset for Enhancing Large Language Models   in Recommendations,"Zekun Liu, Xiaowen Huang, Jitao Sang","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in natural language processing tasks. However, in the field of recommendation systems, due to the structural differences between user behavior data and natural language, LLMs struggle to effectively model the associations between user preferences and items. Although prompt-based methods can generate recommendation results, their inadequate understanding of recommendation tasks leads to constrained performance. To address this gap, in this work, we construct a sufficient instruction tuning dataset, ITDR, which encompasses 7 subtasks across two core root tasks--user-item interaction and user-item understanding. The dataset integrates data from 13 public recommendation datasets and is built using manually crafted standardized templates, comprising approximately 200,000 instances. Experimental results demonstrate that ITDR significantly enhances the performance of mainstream open-source LLMs such as GLM-4, Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Instruct and LLaMA-3.2 on recommendation tasks. Furthermore, we analyze the correlations between tasks and explore the impact of task descriptions and data scale on instruction tuning effectiveness.

Network Prebunking Problem: Optimizing Prebunking Targets to Suppress   the Spread of Misinformation in Social Networks,"Satoshi Furutani, Toshiki Shibahara, Mitsuaki Akiyama, Masaki Aida","As a countermeasure against misinformation that undermines the healthy use of social media, a preventive intervention known as prebunking has recently attracted attention in the field of psychology. Prebunking aims to strengthen individuals' cognitive resistance to misinformation by presenting weakened doses of misinformation or by teaching common manipulation techniques before they encounter actual misinformation. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at the individual level, an important open question remains: how best to identify the optimal targets for prebunking interventions to mitigate the spread of misinformation in a social network. To address this issue, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, called the network prebunking problem, to identify optimal prebunking targets for minimizing the spread of misinformation in a social network. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and propose an approximation algorithm, MIA-NPP, based on the Maximum Influence Arborescence (MIA) approach, which restricts influence propagation around each node to a local directed tree rooted at that node. Through numerical experiments using real-world social network datasets, we demonstrate that MIA-NPP effectively suppresses the spread of misinformation under both fully observed and uncertain model parameter settings.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01124v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01124v1,cs.SI
Recovering Individual-Level Activity Sequences from Location-Based   Service Data Using a Novel Transformer-Based Model,"Weiyu Luo, Chenfeng Xiong","Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences, making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse, realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS data utility for mobility analysis.

However, this greater presence in the digital public sphere has also increased their exposure to harassment and hate speech, particularly in the case of women journalists. This study analyzes the presence of harassment and hate speech in responses (n = 60,684) to messages that 200 journalists and media outlets posted on X (formerly Twitter) accounts during the days immediately preceding and following the July 23 (23-J) general elections held in Spain in 2023. The results indicate that the most common forms of harassment were insults and political hate, which were more frequently aimed at personal accounts than institutional ones, highlighting the significant role of political polarization-particularly during election periods-in shaping the hostility that journalists face. Moreover, although, generally speaking, the total number of harassing messages was similar for men and women, it was found that a greater number of sexist messages were aimed at women journalists, and an ideological dimension was identified in the hate speech that extremists or right-wing populists directed at them. This study corroborates that this is a minor but systemic issue, particularly from a political and gender perspective. To counteract this, the media must develop proactive policies and protective actions extending even to the individual level, where this issue usually applies.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01125v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01125v1,cs.SI

However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person visual inputs in a unified framework.

CarbonScaling: Extending Neural Scaling Laws for Carbon Footprint in   Large Language Models,"Lei Jiang, Fan Chen","Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents \textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06524v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06524v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.DC, cs.LG"
Towards Bridging Review Sparsity in Recommendation with Textual Edge   Graph Representation,"Leyao Wang, Xutao Mao, Xuhui Zhan, Yuying Zhao, Bo Ni, Ryan A. Rossi, Nesreen K. Ahmed, Tyler Derr","Textual reviews enrich recommender systems with fine-grained preference signals and enhanced explainability. However, in real-world scenarios, users rarely leave reviews, resulting in severe sparsity that undermines the effectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate missing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques -- such as matrix completion and LLM-based augmentation -- either lose contextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook structural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these shortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual Edge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by jointly modeling semantic and structural signals. Specifically, we represent user-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), treating reviews as edge attributes. To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and employ a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction lacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's natural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized review. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER consistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines, delivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced recommendation performance. In summary, TWISTER generates reviews that are more helpful, authentic, and specific, while smoothing structural signals for improved recommendations.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01128v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01128v1,"cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.LG"

Robots must earn the trust of human operators in order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with varying definitions of safety.

Floquet stability of periodically stationary pulses in a short-pulse   fiber laser,"Vrushaly Shinglot, John Zweck","The quantitative modeling and design of modern short-pulse fiber lasers cannot be performed with averaged models because of large variations in the pulse parameters within each round trip. Instead, lumped models obtained by concatenating models for the various components of the laser are required. Since the optical pulses in lumped models are periodic, their linear stability is investigated using the monodromy operator, which is the linearization of the roundtrip operator about the pulse. A gradient-based optimization method is developed to discover periodic pulses. The computation of the gradient of the objective function involves numerical computation of the action of both the round trip operator and the adjoint of the monodromy operator. A novel Fourier split-step method is introduced to compute solutions of the linearization of the nonlinear, nonlocal, stiff equation that models optical propagation in the fiber amplifier. This method is derived by linearizing the two solution operators in a split-step method for the nonlinear equation. The spectrum of the monodromy operator consists of the essential spectrum, for which there is an analytical formula, and the eigenvalues. There is a multiplicity two eigenvalue at $\lambda=1$, which is due to phase and translation invariance. The remaining eigenvalues are determined from a matrix discretization of the monodromy operator. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the numerical methods, show examples of periodically stationary pulses, their spectra and eigenfunctions, and discuss their stability.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02735v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02735v1,"math.NA, cs.NA, math.DS, 35B10, 35Q56, 37L15, 47D06, 78A60 (Primary)"
COLLAGE: Adaptive Fusion-based Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning,"Sateesh Kumar, Shivin Dass, Georgios Pavlakos, Roberto Martín-Martín","In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues. COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g., appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks, where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset.

The essential spectrum of periodically stationary pulses in lumped   models of short-pulse fiber lasers,"Vrushaly Shinglot, John Zweck","In modern short pulse fiber lasers there is significant pulse breathing over each round trip of the laser loop. Consequently, averaged models cannot be used for quantitative modeling and design. Instead, lumped models, which are obtained by concatenating models for the various components of the laser, are required. Since the pulses in lumped models are periodic rather than stationary, their linear stability is evaluated with the aid of the monodromy operator obtained by linearizing the round trip operator about the periodic pulse. Conditions are given on the smoothness and decay of the periodic pulse which ensure that the monodromy operator exists on an appropriate Lebesgue function space. A formula for the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator is given which can be used to quantify the growth rate of continuous wave perturbations. This formula is established by showing that the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator equals that of an associated asymptotic operator. Since the asymptotic monodromy operator acts as a multiplication operator in the Fourier domain, it is possible to derive a formula for its spectrum. Although the main results are stated for a particular experimental stretched pulse laser, the analysis shows that they can be readily adapted to a wide range of lumped laser models.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01133v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01133v1,"physics.optics, cs.NA, math.FA, math.NA, math.SP, 35B10, 35Q56, 37L15, 47D06, 78A60 (Primary)"

In this paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated through experiments.

DBAIOps: A Reasoning LLM-Enhanced Database Operation and Maintenance   System using Knowledge Graphs,"Wei Zhou, Peng Sun, Xuanhe Zhou, Qianglei Zang, Ji Xu, Tieying Zhang, Guoliang Li, Fan Wu","The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods, including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g., metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+) reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01136v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01136v1,"cs.DB, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.IR, cs.LG"

The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and 578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing (unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization, skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7% (image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset, indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its potential for real-world clinical applications.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01137v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01137v1,cs.CV
AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF,"Yusheng Zheng, Yanpeng Hu, Tong Yu, Andi Quinn","Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.",2025-08-02,2025-08-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02736v2,"cs.OS, cs.SE"
Dataset Condensation with Color Compensation,"Huyu Wu, Duo Su, Junjie Hou, Guang Li","Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues.

Error estimates of linear decoupled structure-preserving incremental   viscosity splitting methods for the Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes system,"Baolin Kuang, Hongfei Fu, Xiaoli Li","We propose first- and second-order time discretization schemes for the coupled Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes model, leveraging the incremental viscosity splitting (IVS) method. The schemes combine the scalar auxiliary variable method and the zero-energy-contribution approach, resulting in a linear, decoupled numerical framework. At each time step, they only require to solve a sequence of constant-coefficient equations, along with a linear equation with one unknown, making the algorithms computationally efficient and easy to implement. In addition, the proposed schemes are proven to be uniquely solvable, mass-conserving, and unconditional energy dissipation. Most importantly, leveraging the mathematical induction method and the regularity properties of the Stokes equation, we perform a rigorous error analysis for the first-order scheme in multiple space dimensions, establishing an unconditional and optimal convergence rate for all relevant variables under different norms. A user-defined, time-dependent parameter plays an important role in the error analysis of the proposed structure-preserving IVS methods. Ample numerical examples are carried out to verify the theoretical findings and to demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed schemes.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01141v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01141v1,"math.NA, cs.NA, 35Q35, 65M12, 65M15, 76D05"
Generative AI-Driven Decision-Making for Disease Control and Pandemic   Preparedness Model 4.0 in Rural Communities of Bangladesh: Management   Informatics Approach,"Mohammad Saddam Hosen, MD Shahidul Islam Fakir, Shamal Chandra Hawlader, Farzana Rahman, Tasmim Karim, Muhammed Habil Uddin","Rural Bangladesh is confronted with substantial healthcare obstacles, such as inadequate infrastructure, inadequate information systems, and restricted access to medical personnel. These obstacles impede effective disease control and pandemic preparedness. This investigation employs a structured methodology to develop and analyze numerous plausible scenarios systematically. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented, which involved the administration of a questionnaire survey to 264 rural residents in the Rangamati district of Bangladesh and the completion of a distinct questionnaire by 103 healthcare and medical personnel. The impact and effectiveness of the study are assessed through logistic regression analysis and a pre-post comparison that employs the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Kendall's coefficient for non-parametric paired and categorical variables. This analysis evaluates the evolution of disease control and preparedness prior to and subsequent to the implementation of the Generative AI-Based Model 4.0. The results indicate that trust in AI (\b{eta} = 1.20, p = 0.020) and confidence in sharing health data (\b{eta} = 9.049, p = 0.020) are the most significant predictors of AI adoption. At the same time, infrastructure limitations and digital access constraints continue to be significant constraints. The study concludes that the health resilience and pandemic preparedness of marginalized rural populations can be improved through AI-driven, localized disease control strategies. The integration of Generative AI into rural healthcare systems offers a transformative opportunity, but it is contingent upon active community engagement, enhanced digital literacy, and strong government involvement.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01142v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01142v1,"cs.CY, econ.GN, q-fin.EC"
Beyond Algorithmic Proofs: Towards Implementation-Level Provable   Security,"Jiahui Shang, Luning Zhang, Zhongxiang Zheng","While traditional cryptographic research focuses on algorithm-level provable security, many real-world attacks exploit weaknesses in system implementations, such as memory mismanagement, poor entropy sources, and insecure key lifecycles. Existing approaches address these risks in isolation but lack a unified, verifiable framework for modeling implementation-layer security. In this work, we propose Implementation-Level Provable Security, a new paradigm that defines security in terms of structurally verifiable resilience against real-world attack surfaces during deployment. To demonstrate its feasibility, we present SEER (Secure and Efficient Encryption-based Erasure via Ransomware), a file destruction system that repurposes and reinforces the encryption core of Babuk ransomware. SEER incorporates key erasure, entropy validation, and execution consistency checks to ensure a well-constrained, auditable attack surface. Our evaluation shows that SEER achieves strong irrecoverability guarantees while maintaining practical performance.

DisTaC: Conditioning Task Vectors via Distillation for Robust Model   Merging,"Kotaro Yoshida, Yuji Naraki, Takafumi Horie, Ryotaro Shimizu, Hiroki Naganuma","Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years. However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1) disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits -- where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01148v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01148v1,cs.LG

In this paper, we present OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding. OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.

Personalized Safety Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Yu Lei, Jinbin Bai, Qingyu Shi, Aosong Feng, Kaidong Yu","Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process, adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores.

Our framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask. Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.

By encoding target labels into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder frameworks.

The core innovation lies in utilizing an amplitude modulation technique with a carrier frequency of approximately 200 Hz. Due to the absence of Pacinian corpuscles in the facial region - receptors responsible for detecting high-frequency vibrations around 200 Hz - only the original low-frequency signal is perceived. Three experiments were conducted. Experiments 1 and 2 were performed on the forehead to confirm that the proposed amplitude modulation method could produce the desired low-frequency perception and to evaluate the subjective quality of the vibration. The results suggested that the proposed method could produce the perception of desired pure low-frequency vibration when applied to the forehead. In Experiment 3, the proposed method was applied to the whole face, and its range of applicability was explored. The results indicated that the original low-frequency vibration was clearly perceptible around the eyes, cheeks, and lower lip area.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01155v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01155v1,cs.HC
H2C: Hippocampal Circuit-inspired Continual Learning for Lifelong   Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving,"Yunlong Lin, Zirui Li, Guodong Du, Xiaocong Zhao, Cheng Gong, Xinwei Wang, Chao Lu, Jianwei Gong","Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD). However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this, we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.

Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3 achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as psychiatry and pain medicine.

Hearing More with Less: Multi-Modal Retrieval-and-Selection Augmented   Conversational LLM-Based ASR,"Bingshen Mu, Hexin Liu, Hongfei Xue, Kun Wei, Lei Xie","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) aims to convert human speech content into corresponding text. In conversational scenarios, effectively utilizing context can enhance its accuracy. Large Language Models' (LLMs) exceptional long-context understanding and reasoning abilities enable LLM-based ASR (LLM-ASR) to leverage historical context for recognizing conversational speech, which has a high degree of contextual relevance. However, existing conversational LLM-ASR methods use a fixed number of preceding utterances or the entire conversation history as context, resulting in significant ASR confusion and computational costs due to massive irrelevant and redundant information. This paper proposes a multi-modal retrieval-and-selection method named MARS that augments conversational LLM-ASR by enabling it to retrieve and select the most relevant acoustic and textual historical context for the current utterance. Specifically, multi-modal retrieval obtains a set of candidate historical contexts, each exhibiting high acoustic or textual similarity to the current utterance. Multi-modal selection calculates the acoustic and textual similarities for each retrieved candidate historical context and, by employing our proposed near-ideal ranking method to consider both similarities, selects the best historical context. Evaluations on the Interspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge dataset show that the LLM-ASR, when trained on only 1.5K hours of data and equipped with the MARS, outperforms the state-of-the-art top-ranking system trained on 179K hours of data.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01166v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01166v1,cs.SD

However, current approaches typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation learning.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01167v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01167v1,"cs.LG, cs.RO"

Consequently, they fail to fully leverage available modalities to capture complementary semantics. To this end, this paper proposes a novel graph-based framework to exploit both intra- and inter-modality interactions, enabling imperfect samples to derive missing semantics from complementary parts for robust MSA. Specifically, we first devise a learnable hypergraph to model intra-modality temporal dependencies to exploit contextual information within each modality. Then, a directed graph is employed to explore inter-modality correlations based on attention mechanism, capturing complementary information across different modalities.

Rather than simply providing answers, the agent engages students in dialogue and inquiry, prompting them to explain concepts and solve problems collaboratively. The platform's design is grounded in educational theory and closely aligned with state learning standards. Initial classroom pilots utilized a multi-method assessment framework combining pre- and post-tests, in-game analytics, and qualitative feedback from students and teachers. Preliminary findings indicate that SPARC significantly increases student engagement, with most participants reporting greater interest in STEM subjects and moderate gains in conceptual understanding observed in post-test results.

The newly added trajectories are initialized using a learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the tracking network.

No Pose at All: Self-Supervised Pose-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting from   Sparse Views,"Ranran Huang, Krystian Mikolajczyk","We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step. Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited for practical applications.

GeHirNet: A Gender-Aware Hierarchical Model for Voice Pathology   Classification,"Fan Wu, Kaicheng Zhao, Elgar Fleisch, Filipe Barata","AI-based voice analysis shows promise for disease diagnostics, but existing classifiers often fail to accurately identify specific pathologies because of gender-related acoustic variations and the scarcity of data for rare diseases. We propose a novel two-stage framework that first identifies gender-specific pathological patterns using ResNet-50 on Mel spectrograms, then performs gender-conditioned disease classification. We address class imbalance through multi-scale resampling and time warping augmentation. Evaluated on a merged dataset from four public repositories, our two-stage architecture with time warping achieves state-of-the-art performance (97.63\% accuracy, 95.25\% MCC), with a 5\% MCC improvement over single-stage baseline.

Embedding-Enhanced Probabilistic Modeling of Ferroelectric Field Effect   Transistors (FeFETs),"Tasnia Nobi Afee, Jack Hutchins, Md Mazharul Islam, Thomas Kampfe, Ahmedullah Aziz","FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling. Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and circuit simulation integration.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02737v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02737v1,"cs.LG, cs.ET"
MARS: A Meta-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Risk-Aware   Multi-Agent Portfolio Management,"Jiayi Chen, Jing Li, Guiling Wang","Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold, allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble. By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis, demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria, significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining competitive returns.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01173v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01173v1,"cs.LG, cs.MA"
RSPO: Risk-Seeking Policy Optimization for Pass@k and Max@k Metrics in   Large Language Models,"Kaichen Zhang, Shenghao Gao, Yuzhong Hong, Haipeng Sun, Junwei Bao, Hongfei Jiang, Yang Song, Hong Dingqian, Hui Xiong","Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the ""hitchhiking"" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations, resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both metrics.

From Taylor Series to Fourier Synthesis: The Periodic Linear Unit,Shiko Kudo,"The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple, monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization, which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers, achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself.",2025-08-02,2025-08-26,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01175v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01175v3,"cs.LG, cs.NA, cs.NE, math.NA, 68T07 (Primary) 42A10, 41A30, 65D15 (Secondary), I.5.1; G.1.2; G.1.6; I.2.6"

Large Language Models Facilitate Vision Reflection in Image   Classification,"Guoyuan An, JaeYoon Kim, SungEui Yoon","This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers, suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and interpretable visual recognition.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06525v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06525v1,cs.CV
A Dynamic Allocation Scheme for Adaptive Shared-Memory Mapping on   Kilo-core RV Clusters for Attention-Based Model Deployment,"Bowen Wang, Marco Bertuletti, Yichao Zhang, Victor J. B.

Large clusters with shared L1 memory, a common architectural pattern, struggle to fully utilize their processing elements (PEs) when scaled up due to reduced throughput in the hierarchical PE-to-L1 intra-cluster interconnect. This paper presents Dynamic Allocation Scheme (DAS), a runtime programmable address remapping hardware unit coupled with a unified memory allocator, designed to minimize data access contention of PEs onto the multi-banked L1. We evaluated DAS on an aggressively scaled-up 1024-PE RISC-V cluster with Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) PE-to-L1 interconnect to demonstrate its potential for improving data locality in large parallel machine learning workloads.

PiKV: KV Cache Management System for Mixture of Experts,"Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu, Ben Lengerich, Ying Nian Wu, Xuhong Wang","As large language models continue to scale up in both size and context length, the memory and communication cost of key-value (KV) cache storage has become a major bottleneck in multi-GPU and multi-node inference. While MoE-based architectures sparsify computation across experts, the corresponding KV caches remain dense and globally synchronized, resulting in significant overhead.   We introduce \textbf{PiKV}, a parallel and distributed KV cache serving framework tailored for MoE architecture. PiKV leverages \textit{expert-sharded KV storage} to partition caches across GPUs, \textit{PiKV routing} to reduce token-to-KV access, and a \textit{PiKV Scheduling} to adaptively retain query-relevant entries.

Benchmarking and Bridging Emotion Conflicts for Multimodal Emotion   Reasoning,"Zhiyuan Han, Beier Zhu, Yanlong Xu, Peipei Song, Xun Yang","Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01181v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01181v1,"cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.MM, cs.SD, eess.AS, 68, I.2.10"
Object Affordance Recognition and Grounding via Multi-scale Cross-modal   Representation Learning,"Xinhang Wan, Dongqiang Gou, Xinwang Liu, En Zhu, Xuming He","A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding.

Categorical Construction of Logically Verifiable Neural Architectures,Logan Nye,"Neural networks excel at pattern recognition but struggle with reliable logical reasoning, often violating basic logical principles during inference. We address this limitation by developing a categorical framework that systematically constructs neural architectures with provable logical guarantees. Our approach treats logical theories as algebraic structures called Lawvere theories, which we transform into neural networks using categorical algebra in the 2-category of parametric maps. Unlike existing methods that impose logical constraints during training, our categorical construction embeds logical principles directly into the network's architectural structure, making logical violations mathematically impossible. We demonstrate this framework by constructing differentiable neural architectures for propositional logic that preserve boolean reasoning while remaining trainable via gradient descent. Our main theoretical result establishes a bijective correspondence between finitary logical theories and neural architectures, proving that every logically constrained network arises uniquely from our construction. This extends Categorical Deep Learning beyond geometric symmetries to semantic constraints, enabling automatic derivation of verified architectures from logical specifications. The framework provides mathematical foundations for trustworthy AI systems, with applications to theorem proving, formal verification, and safety-critical reasoning tasks requiring verifiable logical behavior.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11647v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11647v1,"cs.LO, cs.AI"

Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens,"Chengshuai Zhao, Zhen Tan, Pingchuan Ma, Dawei Li, Bohan Jiang, Yancheng Wang, Yingzhen Yang, Huan Liu","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions.

Adaptive Content Restriction for Large Language Models via Suffix   Optimization,"Yige Li, Peihai Jiang, Jun Sun, Peng Shu, Tianming Liu, Zhen Xiang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction} (AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named \textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches, including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark} (CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8 carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively.

Efficient compilation and execution of synchronous programs via   type-state programming,Avinash Malik,"Synchronous programs are used extensively in implementation of safety critical embedded software. Imperative synchronous programming languages model multiple Finite State Machines (FSMs) executing in lockstep at logical clock ticks. The synchronous view of time along with the FSM based design enables easier formal verification. The synchronous composition of multiple FSMs, during compilation, results in the well known state space explosion problem. Hence, efficiently compiling imperative synchronous programs into small and fast executables is challenging. This paper introduces a novel linear time compilation technique for automata based compilation of synchronous programs. Graph based rewrite rules for kernel programming constructs are introduced. A linear time algorithm applies these rules to produce a FSM. The FSM is then encoded into a type-state program using template meta-programming in C++. Experimental results show that the compilation time and generated binary size is comparable, while the execution times are on average 31-60% faster than current state-of-the-art compilers.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01199v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01199v1,cs.PL

First, we propose a novel design framework to explore the relationship between antenna positions and achievable data rate. By introducing the continuous antenna position function (APF) and antenna density function (ADF), we reformulate the antenna position design problem from the discrete to the continuous domain, which maximizes the achievable rate functional with respect to ADF. Leveraging functional analysis and variational methods, we derive the optimal ADF condition and propose a gradient-based algorithm for numerical solutions under general channel conditions. Furthermore, for the near-field line-of-sight (LoS) scenario, we present a closed-form solution for the optimal ADF, revealing the critical role of edge antenna density in enhancing the achievable rate. Finally, we propose a flexible antenna array-based deployment method that ensures practical implementation while mitigating mutual coupling issues. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with uniform circular arrays emerging as a promising geometry for balancing performance and deployment feasibility in near-field communications.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01201v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01201v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"
Importance Sampling is All You Need: Predict LLM's performance on new   benchmark by reusing existing benchmark,"Junjie Shi, Wei Ma, Shi Ying, Lingxiao Jiang, Yang liu, Bo Du","With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation, we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources, offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1. These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in code-related tasks.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01203v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01203v1,cs.AI
Conquering High Packet-Loss Erasure: MoE Swin Transformer-Based Video   Semantic Communication,"Lei Teng, Senran Fan, Chen Dong, Haotai Liang, Zhicheng Bao, Xiaodong Xu, Rui Meng, Ping Zhang","Semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding robustly transmits diverse data modalities but faces challenges in mitigating semantic information loss due to packet drops in packet-based systems. Under current protocols, packets with errors are discarded, preventing the receiver from utilizing erroneous semantic data for robust decoding. To address this issue, a packet-loss-resistant MoE Swin Transformer-based Video Semantic Communication (MSTVSC) system is proposed in this paper. Semantic vectors are encoded by MSTVSC and transmitted through upper-layer protocol packetization. To investigate the impact of the packetization, a theoretical analysis of the packetization strategy is provided. To mitigate the semantic loss caused by packet loss, a 3D CNN at the receiver recovers missing information using un-lost semantic data and an packet-loss mask matrix. Semantic-level interleaving is employed to reduce concentrated semantic loss from packet drops. To improve compression, a common-individual decomposition approach is adopted, with downsampling applied to individual information to minimize redundancy. The model is lightweighted for practical deployment. Extensive simulations and comparisons demonstrate strong performance, achieving an MS-SSIM greater than 0.6 and a PSNR exceeding 20 dB at a 90% packet loss rate.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01205v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01205v1,"cs.ET, cs.AI, cs.MM"
Deep Learning for Pavement Condition Evaluation Using Satellite Imagery,"Prathyush Kumar Reddy Lebaku, Lu Gao, Pan Lu, Jingran Sun","Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.

Calibrated Prediction Set in Fault Detection with Risk Guarantees via   Significance Tests,"Mingchen Mei, Yi Li, YiYao Qian, Zijun Jia","Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$) and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative, uncertainty-aware outputs.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01208v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01208v1,cs.AI
Oldie but Goodie: Re-illuminating Label Propagation on Graphs with   Partially Observed Features,"Sukwon Yun, Xin Liu, Yunhak Oh, Junseok Lee, Tianlong Chen, Tsuyoshi Murata, Chanyoung Park","In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed. In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation (Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention. Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE, outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few features are available but also in abundantly available situations.

RoadMamba: A Dual Branch Visual State Space Model for Road Surface   Classification,"Tianze Wang, Zhang Zhang, Chao Yue, Nuoran Li, Chao Sun","Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies provides effective information for the planning and control system of autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba. Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.

Multi-Operator Few-Shot Learning for Generalization Across PDE Families,"Yile Li, Shandian Zhe","Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i) multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities. Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants, demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each modality and training component.

We find that, despite the familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to converge with experience.

StyDeco: Unsupervised Style Transfer with Distilling Priors and Semantic   Decoupling,"Yuanlin Yang, Quanjian Song, Zhexian Gao, Ge Wang, Shanshan Li, Xiaoyan Zhang","Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer, but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper, we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling (CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters. Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility.

Perspective from a Broader Context: Can Room Style Knowledge Help Visual   Floorplan Localization?,"Bolei Chen, Shengsheng Yan, Yongzheng Cui, Jiaxu Kang, Ping Zhong, Jianxin Wang","Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty. In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness and accuracy.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01216v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01216v1,"cs.CV, cs.RO"
Uncertainty Quantification for Large-Scale Deep Networks via Post-StoNet   Modeling,"Yan Sun, Faming Liang","Deep learning has revolutionized modern data science. However, how to accurately quantify the uncertainty of predictions from large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) remains an unresolved issue. To address this issue, we introduce a novel post-processing approach. This approach feeds the output from the last hidden layer of a pre-trained large-scale DNN model into a stochastic neural network (StoNet), then trains the StoNet with a sparse penalty on a validation dataset and constructs prediction intervals for future observations. We establish a theoretical guarantee for the validity of this approach; in particular, the parameter estimation consistency for the sparse StoNet is essential for the success of this approach. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can construct honest confidence intervals with shorter interval lengths compared to conformal methods and achieves better calibration compared to other post-hoc calibration techniques. Additionally, we show that the StoNet formulation provides us with a platform to adapt sparse learning theory and methods from linear models to DNNs.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01217v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01217v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG"

However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency.

Eigen Neural Network: Unlocking Generalizable Vision with Eigenbasis,"Anzhe Cheng, Chenzhong Yin, Mingxi Cheng, Shukai Duan, Shahin Nazarian, Paul Bogdan","The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP, ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval. Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient, backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$ training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy of end-to-end backpropagation.

Multi-Cache Enhanced Prototype Learning for Test-Time Generalization of   Vision-Language Models,"Xinyu Chen, Haotian Zhai, Can Zhang, Xiupeng Shi, Ruirui Li","In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples.

CM$^3$: Calibrating Multimodal Recommendation,"Xin Zhou, Yongjie Wang, Zhiqi Shen","Alignment and uniformity are fundamental principles within the domain of contrastive learning. In recommender systems, prior work has established that optimizing the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss contributes to the objectives of alignment and uniformity. Specifically, alignment aims to draw together the representations of interacting users and items, while uniformity mandates a uniform distribution of user and item embeddings across a unit hypersphere. This study revisits the alignment and uniformity properties within the context of multimodal recommender systems, revealing a proclivity among extant models to prioritize uniformity to the detriment of alignment. Our hypothesis challenges the conventional assumption of equitable item treatment through a uniformity loss, proposing a more nuanced approach wherein items with similar multimodal attributes converge toward proximal representations within the hyperspheric manifold. Specifically, we leverage the inherent similarity between items' multimodal data to calibrate their uniformity distribution, thereby inducing a more pronounced repulsive force between dissimilar entities within the embedding space. A theoretical analysis elucidates the relationship between this calibrated uniformity loss and the conventional uniformity function. Moreover, to enhance the fusion of multimodal features, we introduce a Spherical B\'ezier method designed to integrate an arbitrary number of modalities while ensuring that the resulting fused features are constrained to the same hyperspherical manifold. Empirical evaluations conducted on five real-world datasets substantiate the superiority of our approach over competing baselines.

Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step. In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and succession trajectories compared to a mechanistic version of FINN. Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible, improved functional form of the growth process, which we extracted from the DNN using explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.",2025-08-02,2025-08-28,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01228v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01228v2,"q-bio.QM, cs.LG, stat.ML"
Towed Movable Antenna (ToMA) Array for Ultra Secure Airborne   Communications,"Lipeng Zhu, Haobin Mao, Wenyan Ma, Zhenyu Xiao, Jun Zhang, Rui Zhang","This paper proposes a novel towed movable antenna (ToMA) array architecture to enhance the physical layer security of airborne communication systems. Unlike conventional onboard arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the ToMA array employs multiple subarrays mounted on flexible cables and towed by distributed drones, enabling agile deployment in three-dimensional (3D) space surrounding the central aircraft. This design significantly enlarges the effective array aperture and allows dynamic geometry reconfiguration, offering superior spatial resolution and beamforming flexibility. We consider a secure transmission scenario where an airborne transmitter communicates with multiple legitimate users in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. To ensure security, zero-forcing beamforming is employed to nullify signal leakage toward eavesdroppers. Based on the statistical distributions of locations of users and eavesdroppers, the antenna position vector (APV) of the ToMA array is optimized to maximize the users' ergodic achievable rate. Analytical results for the case of a single user and a single eavesdropper reveal the optimal APV structure that minimizes their channel correlation. For the general multiuser scenario, we develop a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm by leveraging Riemannian manifold optimization. Simulation results confirm that the proposed ToMA array achieves significant performance gains over conventional onboard FPA arrays, especially in scenarios where eavesdroppers are closely located to users under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant channels.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01229v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01229v1,"cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT"
Point-wise Diffusion Models for Physical Systems with Shape Variations:   Application to Spatio-temporal and Large-scale system,"Jiyong Kim, Sunwoong Yang, Namwoo Kang","This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to 200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01230v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01230v1,"physics.comp-ph, cs.CV"

Mitigating Information Loss under High Pruning Rates for Efficient Large   Vision Language Models,"Mingyu Fu, Wei Suo, Ji Ma, Lin Yuanbo Wu, Peng Wang, Yanning Zhang","Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method (ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates. Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6% with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01236v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01236v1,cs.CV
SketchAgent: Generating Structured Diagrams from Hand-Drawn Sketches,"Cheng Tan, Qi Chen, Jingxuan Wei, Gaowei Wu, Zhangyang Gao, Siyuan Li, Bihui Yu, Ruifeng Guo, Stan Z. Li","Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering, while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive sketching and machine-readable diagram generation.

Finite element conformal complexes in three dimensions,Xuehai Huang,"This paper extends the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) framework to the construction of finite element conformal Hessian complexes and conformal elasticity complexes in three dimensions involving conformal tensors (i.e., symmetric and traceless tensors). These complexes incorporate higher-order differential operators, including the linearized Cotton-York operator, and require conformal tensor spaces with nontrivial smoothness and trace conditions. A novel application of the discrete BGG framework, combined with the geometric decomposition of bubble spaces and a reduction operation, to local bubble finite element complexes is introduced. This yields simpler and more tractable constructions than global BGG-based approaches, and leads to the bubble conformal complexes. Building on these bubble conformal complexes and the associated face bubble complexes, finite element conformal Hessian complexes and conformal elasticity complexes with varying degrees of smoothness are systematically developed. The resulting complexes support stable and structure-preserving numerical methods for applications in relativity, Cosserat elasticity, and fluid mechanics.",2025-08-02,2025-08-06,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01238v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01238v2,"math.NA, cs.NA, 65N30, 58J10, 65N12"
OCSplats: Observation Completeness Quantification and Label Noise   Separation in 3DGS,"Han Ling, Xian Xu, Yinghui Sun, Quansen Sun","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01239v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01239v1,cs.CV

We leverage imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various sources in the interpolated map.

Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The 3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity.

Effective and Efficient Conductance-based Community Search at Billion   Scale,"Longlong Lin, Yue He, Wei Chen, Pingpeng Yuan, Rong-Hua Li, Tao Jia","Community search is a widely studied semi-supervised graph clustering problem, retrieving a high-quality connected subgraph containing the user-specified query vertex. However, existing methods primarily focus on cohesiveness within the community but ignore the sparsity outside the community, obtaining sub-par results. Inspired by this, we adopt the well-known conductance metric to measure the quality of a community and introduce a novel problem of conductance-based community search (CCS). CCS aims at finding a subgraph with the smallest conductance among all connected subgraphs that contain the query vertex. We prove that the CCS problem is NP-hard. To efficiently query CCS, a four-stage subgraph-conductance-based community search algorithm, SCCS, is proposed. Specifically, we first greatly reduce the entire graph using local sampling techniques. Then, a three-stage local optimization strategy is employed to continuously refine the community quality. Namely, we first utilize a seeding strategy to obtain an initial community to enhance its internal cohesiveness. Then, we iteratively add qualified vertices in the expansion stage to guarantee the internal cohesiveness and external sparsity of the community. Finally, we gradually remove unqualified vertices during the verification stage.

To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique, and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality, defect-aware training data.

NS-Net: Decoupling CLIP Semantic Information through NULL-Space for   Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection,"Jiazhen Yan, Fan Wang, Weiwei Jiang, Ziqiang Li, Zhangjie Fu","The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net, a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and generated images.

However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools & data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations.

While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions. WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to guide component separation using language supervision implicitly.

Soft Separation and Distillation: Toward Global Uniformity in Federated   Unsupervised Learning,"Hung-Chieh Fang, Hsuan-Tien Lin, Irwin King, Yifei Zhang","Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space. However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local) uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global) uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions. This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby improving global uniformity while preserving local representation expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation quality and task performance across various training scenarios.

Self-Enhanced Image Clustering with Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency,"Zihan Li, Wei Sun, Jing Hu, Jianhua Yin, Jianlong Wu, Liqiang Nie","While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement. In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label generator.

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they often suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in stagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. In this paper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates lightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively. TestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and improves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target line instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close test cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the target line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and (3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode variable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these targeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test generation and mitigates redundant explorations.

To obtain a multiplicative $\big(1\pm O(1)\big)$-approximation of $\pi(t)$ with probability $\Omega(1)$, the previously best upper bound is $O(n^{1/2}\min\{ \Delta_{in}^{1/2},\Delta_{out}^{1/2},m^{1/4}\})$ from [Wang, Wei, Wen, Yang STOC '24], where $n$ and $m$ denote the number of nodes and edges in $G$, and $\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ upper bound the in-degrees and out-degrees of $G$, respectively. The same paper implicitly gives the previously best lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/2}\min\{\Delta_{in}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},\Delta_{out}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},m^{1/4}\})$, where $\gamma=\frac{\log(1/(1-\alpha))}{4\log\Delta_{in}-2\log(1/(1-\alpha))}$ if $\Delta_{in}>1/(1-\alpha)$, and $\gamma=1/2$ if $\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$. As $\gamma$ only depends on $\Delta_{in}$, the known upper bound is tight if we only parameterize the complexity by $n$, $m$, and $\Delta_{out}$. However, there remains a gap of $\Omega(n^{\gamma})$ when considering $\Delta_{in}$, and this gap is large when $\Delta_{in}$ is small. In the extreme case where $\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$, we have $\gamma=1/2$, leading to a gap of $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ between the bounds $O(n^{1/2})$ and $\Omega(1)$.   In this paper, we present a new algorithm that achieves the above lower bound (up to logarithmic factors). The algorithm assumes that $n$ and the bounds $\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ are known in advance. Our key technique is a novel randomized backwards propagation process which only propagates selectively based on Monte Carlo estimated PageRank scores.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01257v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01257v1,cs.DS
New constant-dimension subspace codes from parallel cosets of optimal   Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes and multilevel inserting constructions,"Gang Wang, Hong-Yang Yao, Fang-Wei Fu","Constant-dimension subspace codes (CDCs), a special class of subspace codes, have attracted significant attention due to their applications in network coding. A fundamental research problem of CDCs is to determine the maximum number of codewords under the given parameters. The paper first proposes the construction of parallel cosets of optimal Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes (FDRMCs) by employing the list of CDCs and inverse list of CDCs. Then a new class of CDCs is obtained by combining the parallel cosets of optimal FDRMCs with parallel linkage construction. Next, we present a novel set of identifying vectors and provide a new construction of CDCs via the multilevel constuction. Finally, the coset construction is inserted into the multilevel construction and three classes of large CDCs are provided, one of which is constructed by using new optimal FDRMCs. Our results establish at least 65 new lower bounds for CDCs with larger sizes than the previously best known codes.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01258v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01258v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"
SpatioTemporal Difference Network for Video Depth Super-Resolution,"Zhengxue Wang, Yuan Wu, Xiang Li, Zhiqiang Yan, Jian Yang","Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01259v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01259v1,cs.CV
Unifying Mixture of Experts and Multi-Head Latent Attention for   Efficient Language Models,"Sushant Mehta, Raj Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat","We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with 64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6 of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss optimization.   Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass. FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10), creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10).

The challenge tasked participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness, solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios.

Enhancing Diffusion-based Dataset Distillation via Adversary-Guided   Curriculum Sampling,"Lexiao Zou, Gongwei Chen, Yanda Chen, Miao Zhang","Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01264v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01264v1,cs.CV
A Study on Enhancing User Engagement by Employing Gamified Recommender   Systems,"Ali Fallahi, Azam Bastanfard, Amineh Amini, Hadi Saboohi","Providing customized products and services in the modern business world is one of the most efficient solutions to improve users' experience and their engagements with the industries. To aim, recommender systems, by producing personalized recommendations, have a crucial role in the digital age. As a consequence of modern improvements in the internet and online-based technologies, using gamification rules also increased in various fields. Recent studies showed that considering gamification concepts in implementing recommendation systems not only can become helpful to overcome the cold start and lack of sufficient data, moreover, can effectively improve user engagement. Gamification can motivate individuals to have more activities on the system; these interactions are valuable resources of data for recommender engines. Unlike the past related works about using gamified recommendation systems in different environments or studies that particularly surveyed gamification strategies or recommenders separately, this work provides a comprehensive review of how gamified recommender systems can enhance user engagement in various domain applications. Furthermore, comparing different approaches for building recommender systems is followed by in-depth surveying about investigating the gamified recommender systems, including their approaches, limitations, evaluation metrics, proposed achievements, datasets, domain areas, and their recommendation techniques.

Win-k: Improved Membership Inference Attacks on Small Language Models,"Roya Arkhmammadova, Hosein Madadi Tamar, M. Emre Gursoy","Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models (LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore, their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR metrics, especially on smaller models.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01268v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01268v1,"cs.AI, cs.CR"

SGCap: Decoding Semantic Group for Zero-shot Video Captioning,"Zeyu Pan, Ping Li, Wenxiao Wang","Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored. Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships. Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision (PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones.

PromptSafe: Gated Prompt Tuning for Safe Text-to-Image Generation,"Zonglei Jing, Xiao Yang, Xiaoqian Li, Siyuan Liang, Aishan Liu, Mingchuan Zhang, Xianglong Liu","Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality, but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%), while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.",2025-08-02,2025-08-14,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01272v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01272v2,cs.CV
KCR: Resolving Long-Context Knowledge Conflicts via Reasoning in LLMs,"Xianda Zheng, Zijian Huang, Meng-Fen Chiang, Michael J. Witbrock, Kaiqi Zhao","Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR) framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge. The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts. Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.",2025-08-02,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01273v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01273v2,cs.AI

Integrating Disparity Confidence Estimation into Relative Depth   Prior-Guided Unsupervised Stereo Matching,"Chuang-Wei Liu, Mingjian Sun, Cairong Zhao, Hanli Wang, Alexander Dvorkovich, Rui Fan","Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks. However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically, the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence. Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance at disparity discontinuities.

Defending Against Beta Poisoning Attacks in Machine Learning Models,"Nilufer Gulciftci, M. Emre Gursoy","Poisoning attacks, in which an attacker adversarially manipulates the training dataset of a machine learning (ML) model, pose a significant threat to ML security. Beta Poisoning is a recently proposed poisoning attack that disrupts model accuracy by making the training dataset linearly nonseparable. In this paper, we propose four defense strategies against Beta Poisoning attacks: kNN Proximity-Based Defense (KPB), Neighborhood Class Comparison (NCC), Clustering-Based Defense (CBD), and Mean Distance Threshold (MDT). The defenses are based on our observations regarding the characteristics of poisoning samples generated by Beta Poisoning, e.g., poisoning samples have close proximity to one another, and they are centered near the mean of the target class. Experimental evaluations using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that KPB and MDT can achieve perfect accuracy and F1 scores, while CBD and NCC also provide strong defensive capabilities.

Foundation Models for Bioacoustics -- a Comparative Review,"Raphael Schwinger, Paria Vali Zadeh, Lukas Rauch, Mats Kurz, Tom Hauschild, Sam Lapp, Sven Tomforde","Automated bioacoustic analysis is essential for biodiversity monitoring and conservation, requiring advanced deep learning models that can adapt to diverse bioacoustic tasks. This article presents a comprehensive review of large-scale pretrained bioacoustic foundation models and systematically investigates their transferability across multiple bioacoustic classification tasks. We overview bioacoustic representation learning including major pretraining data sources and benchmarks. On this basis, we review bioacoustic foundation models by thoroughly analysing design decisions such as model architecture, pretraining scheme, and training paradigm. Additionally, we evaluate selected foundation models on classification tasks from the BEANS and BirdSet benchmarks, comparing the generalisability of learned representations under both linear and attentive probing strategies. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that BirdMAE, trained on large-scale bird song data with a self-supervised objective, achieves the best performance on the BirdSet benchmark. On BEANS, BEATs$_{NLM}$, the extracted encoder of the NatureLM-audio large audio model, is slightly better. Both transformer-based models require attentive probing to extract the full performance of their representations. ConvNext$_{BS}$ and Perch models trained with supervision on large-scale bird song data remain competitive for passive acoustic monitoring classification tasks of BirdSet in linear probing settings. Training a new linear classifier has clear advantages over evaluating these models without further training.

Semantic-Aware LLM Orchestration for Proactive Resource Management in   Predictive Digital Twin Vehicular Networks,Seyed Hossein Ahmadpanah,"Next-generation automotive applications require vehicular edge computing (VEC), but current management systems are essentially fixed and reactive. They are suboptimal in extremely dynamic vehicular environments because they are constrained to static optimization objectives and base their decisions on the current network states. This paper presents a novel Semantic-Aware Proactive LLM Orchestration (SP-LLM) framework to address these issues. Our method transforms the traditional Digital Twin (DT) into a Predictive Digital Twin (pDT) that predicts important network parameters such as task arrivals, vehicle mobility, and channel quality. A Large Language Model (LLM) that serves as a cognitive orchestrator is at the heart of our framework. It makes proactive, forward-looking decisions about task offloading and resource allocation by utilizing the pDT's forecasts. The LLM's ability to decipher high-level semantic commands given in natural language is crucial because it enables it to dynamically modify its optimization policy to match evolving strategic objectives, like giving emergency services priority or optimizing energy efficiency. We show through extensive simulations that SP-LLM performs significantly better in terms of scalability, robustness in volatile conditions, and adaptability than state-of-the-art reactive and MARL-based approaches. More intelligent, autonomous, and goal-driven vehicular networks will be possible due to our framework's outstanding capacity to convert human intent into optimal network behavior.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09149v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09149v1,"cs.NI, cs.DC"
A graph neural network based on feature network for identifying   influential nodes,"Yanmei Hu, Siyuan Yin, Yihang Wu, Xue Yue, Yue Liu","Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is of great importance, and has many applications in practice. For example, finding influential nodes in e-commerce network can provide merchants with customers with strong purchase intent; identifying influential nodes in computer information system can help locating the components that cause the system break down and identifying influential nodes in these networks can accelerate the flow of information in networks. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made on the problem of indentifying influential nodes. However, previous efforts either consider only one aspect of the network structure, or using global centralities with high time consuming as node features to identify influential nodes, and the existing methods do not consider the relationships between different centralities. To solve these problems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature Network, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as GCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency, FNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among the local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are determined. By taking a shallow GCN and a deep GCN into the FNGCN framework, two FNGCNs are developed.

ViseGPT: Towards Better Alignment of LLM-generated Data Wrangling   Scripts and User Prompts,"Jiajun Zhu, Xinyu Cheng, Zhongsu Luo, Yunfan Zhou, Xinhuan Shu, Di Weng, Yingcai Wu","Large language models (LLMs) enable the rapid generation of data wrangling scripts based on natural language instructions, but these scripts may not fully adhere to user-specified requirements, necessitating careful inspection and iterative refinement. Existing approaches primarily assist users in understanding script logic and spotting potential issues themselves, rather than providing direct validation of correctness. To enhance debugging efficiency and optimize the user experience, we develop ViseGPT, a tool that automatically extracts constraints from user prompts to generate comprehensive test cases for verifying script reliability. The test results are then transformed into a tailored Gantt chart, allowing users to intuitively assess alignment with semantic requirements and iteratively refine their scripts. Our design decisions are informed by a formative study (N=8) that explores user practices and challenges. We further evaluate the effectiveness and usability of ViseGPT through a user study (N=18). Results indicate that ViseGPT significantly improves debugging efficiency for LLM-generated data-wrangling scripts, enhances users' ability to detect and correct issues, and streamlines the workflow experience.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01279v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01279v1,cs.HC
Blockchain security based on cryptography: a review,"Wenwen Zhou, Dongyang Lyu, Xiaoqi Li","As an emerging service framework built by combining cryptography, P2P network, consensus mechanism and innovative contract technology, blockchain has been widely used in digital finance, data sharing, message traceability and electronic evidence preservation because of its decentralised, non-tamperable and transaction traceability. However, with the complex and changeable application scenarios of blockchain technology and the continuous enhancement of blockchain attack technology, the security of the blockchain system has been seriously threatened, dramatically affecting the development and application of blockchain technology. This paper aims to analyse the attacks on blockchain from the perspective of cryptography. Firstly, from the cryptography technology in the blockchain, the principle of hash functions, digital signatures, and other technologies, as well as their role in the blockchain, are introduced. Then, based on the six-layer architecture of the blockchain, the attacks on the data layer, the network layer, the consensus layer, the contract layer, the incentive layer and the application layer are analysed, and the methods to mitigate or resist the attacks are proposed. Secondly, the attack principles of 51% attack, Double-Spending attack, Reentrancy attack, Replay attack, Sybil attack and Timestamp Tampering attack were analysed, and the mitigation or defence solutions for these six attacks were designed. Finally, the core problems to be solved in blockchain technology are summarised, and the future development of blockchain security technology is projected.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01280v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01280v1,cs.CR
ExplorAR: Assisting Older Adults to Learn Smartphone Apps through   AR-powered Trial-and-Error with Interactive Guidance,"Jiawei Li, Linjie Qiu, Zhiqing Wu, Qiongyan Chen, Ziyan Wang, Mingming Fan","Older adults tend to encounter challenges when learning to use new smartphone apps due to age-related cognitive and physical changes. Compared to traditional support methods such as video tutorials, trial-and-error allows older adults to learn to use smartphone apps by making and correcting mistakes. However, it remains unknown how trial-and-error should be designed to empower older adults to use smartphone apps and how well it would work for older adults. Informed by the guidelines derived from prior work, we designed and implemented ExplorAR, an AR-based trial-and-error system that offers real-time and situated visual guidance in the augmented space around the smartphone to empower older adults to explore and correct mistakes independently. We conducted a user study with 18 older adults to compare ExplorAR with traditional video tutorials and a simplified version of ExplorAR.

On the Characterization and Evaluation of Doppler Squint in Wideband   ODDM Systems,"Xuehan Wang, Jinhong Yuan, Jintao Wang, Zhi Sun","The recently proposed orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has been demonstrated to enjoy excellent reliability over doubly-dispersive channels. However, most of the prior analysis tends to ignore the interactive dispersion caused by the wideband property of ODDM signal, which possibly leads to performance degradation. To solve this problem, we investigate the input-output relation of ODDM systems considering the wideband effect, which is also known as the Doppler squint effect (DSE) in the literature. The extra delay-Doppler (DD) dispersion caused by the DSE is first explicitly explained by employing the time-variant frequency response of multipath channels. Its characterization is then derived for both reduced cyclic prefix (RCP) and zero padded (ZP)-based wideband ODDM systems, where the extra DD spread and more complicated power leakage outside the peak region are presented theoretically. Numerical results are finally provided to confirm the significance of DSE. The derivations in this paper are beneficial for developing accurate signal processing techniques in ODDM-based integrated sensing and communication systems.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01283v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01283v1,"eess.SP, cs.IT, math.IT"

Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures. Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few lines of code.

Exploitation Is All You Need... for Exploration,"Micah Rentschler, Jesse Roberts","Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments. Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1) Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data; and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2). Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01287v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01287v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Prompting Large Language Models with Partial Knowledge for Answering   Questions with Unseen Entities,"Zhichao Yan, Jiapu Wang, Jiaoyan Chen, Yanyan Wang, Hongye Tan, Jiye Liang, Xiaoli Li, Ru Li, Jeff Z. Pan","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows impressive performance by supplementing and substituting parametric knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs). Retrieved knowledge can be divided into three types: explicit answer evidence, implicit answer clue, and insufficient answer context which can be further categorized into totally irrelevant and partially relevant information. Effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge remains a key challenge for RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge base retrieval. Contrary to the conventional view, we propose a new perspective: LLMs can be awakened via partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs. To comprehensively investigate this phenomenon, the triplets located in the gold reasoning path and their variants are used to construct partially relevant knowledge by removing the path that contains the answer. We provide theoretical analysis of the awakening effect in LLMs and support our hypothesis with experiments on two Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets. Furthermore, we present a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, simulating real-world challenges where entity linking fails due to KG incompleteness.

CoCoLIT: ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation for MRI to   Amyloid PET Synthesis,"Alec Sargood, Lemuel Puglisi, James H. Cole, Neil P. Oxtoby, Daniele Ravì, Daniel C. Alexander","Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2) a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external dataset.

GMAT: Grounded Multi-Agent Clinical Description Generation for Text   Encoder in Vision-Language MIL for Whole Slide Image Classification,"Ngoc Bui Lam Quang, Nam Le Nguyen Binh, Thanh-Huy Nguyen, Le Thien Phuc Nguyen, Quan Nguyen, Ulas Bagci","Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01293v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01293v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
FedCD: A Fairness-aware Federated Cognitive Diagnosis Framework,"Shangshang Yang, Jialin Han, Xiaoshan Yu, Ziwen Wang, Hao Jiang, Haiping Ma, Xingyi Zhang, Geyong Min","Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability differences and educational context differences between different groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy, preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly; the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server, containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under three CD models.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01296v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01296v1,"cs.LG, cs.CY"
Improving performance of content-centric networks via decentralized   coded caching for multi-level popularity and access,"Azadeh Sadat Miraftab, Ahmadreza Montazerolghaem, Behrad Mahboobi","Content-Centric Networking (CCN) offers a novel architectural paradigm that seeks to address the inherent limitations of the prevailing Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking model. In contrast to the host-centric communication approach of IP networks, CCN prioritizes content by enabling direct addressing and routing based on content identifiers. The potential performance improvements of CCN can be further amplified through optimized management of coded data storage and transmission strategies. Decentralized Coded Caching (DCC) emerges as a promising technique that harnesses the collective caching power of distributed network elements. By strategically pre-positioning frequently accessed content closer to potential consumers during periods of low network utilization, DCC has the potential to mitigate content transfer rates during peak traffic periods. This paper proposes a series of fundamental modifications to the CCN architecture by integrating DCC. The proposed framework incorporates differentiated coding strategies tailored to user access privileges, thereby eliminating the overhead associated with queue-based searching. Additionally, the framework facilitates recoding of uncoded data encountered along the content delivery path. These combined methodologies demonstrably enhance network throughput, elevate cache hit ratios, and consequently, reduce content delivery latency compared to conventional CCN implementations.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01298v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01298v1,cs.NI
How Far Are LLMs from Symbolic Planners? An NLP-Based Perspective,"Ma'ayan Armony, Albert Meroño-Peñuela, Gerard Canal","The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing (NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner. This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01300v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01300v1,cs.AI
KEDAS: Knowledge Editing Alignment with Diverse Augmentation and   Self-adaptive Inference,"Chenming Tang, Yutong Yang, Yunfang Wu","Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs) efficiently while retaining their powerful capabilities. Most existing methods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches. In this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation and Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge editing. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited knowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit augmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a filter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of inference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the original pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their related edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In experiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of 36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its strong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean scores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both parameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly. Analysis of computational cost and performance on general tasks further validates the robustness and efficiency of KEDAS, indicating that it presents an ideal paradigm of knowledge editing alignment.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01302v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01302v1,cs.CL
Domain Generalized Stereo Matching with Uncertainty-guided Data   Augmentation,"Shuangli Du, Jing Wang, Minghua Zhao, Zhenyu Xu, Jie Li","State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space (mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics. Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization performance of existing SM networks.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01303v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01303v1,"cs.CV, I.2.0; I.2.6"

In response, studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

GraphVSSM: Graph Variational State-Space Model for Probabilistic   Spatiotemporal Inference of Dynamic Exposure and Vulnerability for Regional   Disaster Resilience Assessment,"Joshua Dimasaka, Christian Geiß, Emily So","Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static, costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model (GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset, METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset for UN Least Developed Countries (2020).

However, existing methods are typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module, to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor (KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder. Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers previous category information and returns category-adaptive representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of 66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD, respectively.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01311v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01311v1,"cs.CV, cs.LG"

PGD-based local surrogate models via overlapping domain decomposition: a   computational comparison,"Marco Discacciati, Ben J. Evans, Matteo Giacomini","An efficient strategy to construct physics-based local surrogate models for parametric linear elliptic problems is presented. The method relies on proper generalized decomposition (PGD) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and on an overlapping domain decomposition (DD) strategy to decouple the spatial degrees of freedom. In the offline phase, the local surrogate model is computed in a non-intrusive way, exploiting the linearity of the operator and imposing arbitrary Dirichlet conditions, independently at each node of the interface, by means of the traces of the finite element functions employed for the discretization inside the subdomain. This leads to parametric subproblems with reduced dimensionality, significantly decreasing the complexity of the involved computations and achieving speed-ups up to 100 times with respect to a previously proposed DD-PGD algorithm that required clustering the interface nodes. A fully algebraic alternating Schwarz method is then formulated to couple the subdomains in the online phase, leveraging the real-time (less than half a second) evaluation capabilities of the computed local surrogate models, that do not require the solution of any additional low-dimensional problems.

Physics-Informed Neural Network Approaches for Sparse Data Flow   Reconstruction of Unsteady Flow Around Complex Geometries,"Vamsi Sai Krishna Malineni, Suresh Rajendran","The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets mirroring real-world scenarios.   This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function components.

Physics-Informed Data-Driven Control of Nonlinear Polynomial Systems   with Noisy Data,"MohammadHossein Ashoori, Ali Aminzadeh, Amy Nejati, Abolfazl Lavaei","This work addresses the critical challenge of guaranteeing safety for complex dynamical systems where precise mathematical models are uncertain and data measurements are corrupted by noise. We develop a physics-informed, direct data-driven framework for synthesizing robust safety controllers (R-SCs) for both discrete- and continuous-time nonlinear polynomial systems that are subject to unknown-but-bounded disturbances. To do so, we introduce a notion of safety through robust control barrier certificates (R-CBCs), which ensure avoidance of (potentially multiple) unsafe regions, offering a less conservative alternative to existing methods based on robust invariant sets. Our core innovation lies in integrating the fundamental physical principles with observed noisy data which drastically reduces data requirements, enabling robust safety analysis with significantly shorter trajectories, compared to purely data-driven methods. To achieve this, the proposed synthesis procedure is formulated as a sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program that systematically designs the R-CBC and its associated R-SC by leveraging both collected data and underlying physical laws. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated on four benchmark systems, three discrete-time and one continuous-time nonlinear polynomial systems, confirming its ability to offer robust safety guarantees with reduced data demands.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01315v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01315v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

To address this, we propose a novel multimodal attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1) functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world diagnostic settings.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01316v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01316v1,"cs.CV, cs.HC"

To address this limitation, we propose LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens. Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results.

AffectGPT-R1: Leveraging Reinforcement Learning for Open-Vocabulary   Emotion Recognition,Zheng Lian,"Open-Vocabulary Multimodal Emotion Recognition (OV-MER) aims to predict emotions without being constrained by predefined label spaces, enabling fine-grained and human-like emotion understanding. Unlike traditional discriminative methods, OV-MER leverages generative models, such as large language models (LLMs) with extensive vocabularies, to capture the full spectrum of emotions. Previous approaches (like AffectGPT) primarily rely on token-level loss for training. However, this objective does not align with the emotion wheel (EW)-based evaluation metrics used in OV-MER. Unfortunately, EW-based metrics cannot be directly optimized via gradient backpropagation. In this paper, we propose AffectGPT-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes performance on EW-based metrics. Specifically, we treat these metrics as the reward function and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to maximize rewards.

Flow IV: Counterfactual Inference In Nonseparable Outcome Models Using   Instrumental Variables,"Marc Braun, Jose M. Peña, Adel Daoud","To reach human level intelligence, learning algorithms need to incorporate causal reasoning. But identifying causality, and particularly counterfactual reasoning, remains an elusive task. In this paper, we make progress on this task by utilizing instrumental variables (IVs). IVs are a classic tool for mitigating bias from unobserved confounders when estimating causal effects. While IV methods have been extended to non-separable structural models at the population level, existing approaches to counterfactual prediction typically assume additive noise in the outcome. In this paper, we show that under standard IV assumptions, along with the assumptions that latent noises in treatment and outcome are strictly monotonic and jointly Gaussian, the treatment-outcome relationship becomes uniquely identifiable from observed data. This enables counterfactual inference even in nonseparable models. We implement our approach by training a normalizing flow to maximize the likelihood of the observed data, demonstrating accurate recovery of the underlying outcome function.

SWAN: Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network for Infrared Small Target   Detection,"Yuxin Jing, Jufeng Zhao, Tianpei Zhang, Yiming Zhu","Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is thus critical in both civilian and military applications. This study addresses the challenge of precisely IRSTD in complex backgrounds. Recent methods focus fundamental reliance on conventional convolution operations, which primarily capture local spatial patterns and struggle to distinguish the unique frequency-domain characteristics of small targets from intricate background clutter. To overcome these limitations, we proposed the Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network (SWAN), a novel framework designed to perceive targets from both spatial and frequency domains. SWAN leverages a Haar Wavelet Convolution (HWConv) for a deep, cross-domain fusion of the frequency energy and spatial details of small target. Furthermore, a Shifted Spatial Attention (SSA) mechanism efficiently models long-range spatial dependencies with linear computational complexity, enhancing contextual awareness. Finally, a Residual Dual-Channel Attention (RDCA) module adaptively calibrates channel-wise feature responses to suppress background interference while amplifying target-pertinent signals.

Idempotent Equilibrium Analysis of Hybrid Workflow Allocation: A   Mathematical Schema for Future Work,"Faruk Alpay, Bugra Kilictas, Taylan Alpay, Hamdi Alakkad","The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii) derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* = \alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and $\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI modules rather than competing with them.

Fusion Sampling Validation in Data Partitioning for Machine Learning,"Christopher Godwin Udomboso, Caston Sigauke, Ini Adinya","Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning. Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV) enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples, generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates (ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV, with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288, ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137.

Is Exploration or Optimization the Problem for Deep Reinforcement   Learning?,Glen Berseth,"In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex, as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives, will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$ better than the policies' learned performance.

To address this critical gap, we introduce NaturalGAIA, a novel benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of agents, we developed LightManus, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.

Moreover, while RFT substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR increased from 3.3% to 10.8%), its performance degraded sharply when handling complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception, decision-making, and execution.

Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation with Cross-view Semantics   Interaction Network,"Jiaxing Yang, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu","Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction. In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of feature in every encoding stage.

Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability, and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions.

Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful, may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively.   In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts -- video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance issues that affect the user experience.

Weakly-Supervised Image Forgery Localization via Vision-Language   Collaborative Reasoning Framework,"Ziqi Sheng, Junyan Wu, Wei Lu, Jiantao Zhou","Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL) has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper, we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations. Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads, where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both detection and localization accuracy.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01338v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01338v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"

"Debiasing Machine Learning Predictions for Causal Inference Without   Additional Ground Truth Data: ""One Map, Many Trials"" in Satellite-Driven   Poverty Analysis","Markus Pettersson, Connor T. Jerzak, Adel Daoud","Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, such as satellite imagery, have demonstrated significant promise in predicting household-level wealth indices, enabling the creation of high-resolution wealth maps that can be leveraged across multiple causal trials. However, because standard training objectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions inherently suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of causal treatment effects and limiting their utility in policy. Existing debiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference, can handle this attenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the downstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in data-scarce environments. Here, we introduce and evaluate two correction methods -- linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction -- that substantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled data. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear transformation derived from held-out calibration data, whereas Tweedie's correction leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address shrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from the model's learning patterns. Through analytical exercises and experiments using Demographic and Health Survey data, we demonstrate that the proposed methods meet or outperform existing approaches that either require (a) adjustments to training pipelines or (b) additional labeled data. These approaches may represent a promising avenue for improving the reliability of causal inference when direct outcome measures are limited or unavailable, enabling a ""one map, many trials"" paradigm where a single upstream data creation team produces predictions usable by many downstream teams across diverse ML pipelines.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01341v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01341v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, 62C12, H.3"

We design the following components: An edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph, extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01343v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01343v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI"
Predicting Video Slot Attention Queries from Random Slot-Feature Pairs,"Rongzhen Zhao, Jian Li, Juho Kannala, Joni Pajarinen","Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do. Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame. This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both (\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction (RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction; (\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and training logs are available as the supplement.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01345v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01345v1,cs.CV
MultiCFV: Detecting Control Flow Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts   Leveraging Multimodal Deep Learning,"Hongli Peng, Xiaoqi Li, Wenkai Li","The introduction of smart contract functionality marks the advent of the blockchain 2.0 era, enabling blockchain technology to support digital currency transactions and complex distributed applications. However, many smart contracts have been found to contain vulnerabilities and errors, leading to the loss of assets within the blockchain. Despite a range of tools that have been developed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source code or bytecode level, most rely on a single modality, reducing performance, accuracy, and limited generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning approach, MultiCFV, which is designed specifically to analyze and detect erroneous control flow vulnerability, as well as identify code clones in smart contracts. Bytecode is generated from source code to construct control flow graphs, with graph embedding techniques extracting graph features. Abstract syntax trees are used to obtain syntax features, while code comments capture key commentary words and comment features. These three feature vectors are fused to create a database for code inspection, which is used to detect similar code and identify contract vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively combines structural, syntactic, and semantic information, improving the accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection and clone detection.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01346v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01346v1,cs.CR
Convergence Analysis of Aggregation-Broadcast in LoRA-enabled   Distributed Fine-Tuning,"Xin Chen, Shuaijun Chen, Omid Tavallaie, Nguyen Tran, Shuhuang Xiang, Albert Zomaya","Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS). Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive both weak and strong convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present both weak and strong convergence condition that guarantee convergence of the local model and the global model respectively. These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation methods satisfy the weak and strong convergence condition respectively, but differ in their ability to achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.",2025-08-02,2025-08-30,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01348v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01348v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI"

NATLM: Detecting Defects in NFT Smart Contracts Leveraging LLM,"Yuanzheng Niu, Xiaoqi Li, Wenkai Li","Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid evolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets, they have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of NFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to substantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect potential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies four common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721 Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying exclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a high false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates static analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM employs static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow information from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and Control Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with vectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the knowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the analyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base. Finally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of potential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed 8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%, a recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other baseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01351v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01351v1,cs.CR
Predicting EGFR Mutation in LUAD from Histopathological Whole-Slide   Images Using Pretrained Foundation Model and Transfer Learning: An Indian   Cohort Study,"Sagar Singh Gwal, Rajan, Suyash Devgan, Shraddhanjali Satapathy, Abhishek Goyal, Nuruddin Mohammad Iqbal, Vivaan Jain, Prabhat Singh Mallik, Deepali Jain, Ishaan Gupta","Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.",2025-08-02,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01352v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01352v2,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
HyClone: Bridging LLM Understanding and Dynamic Execution for Semantic   Code Clone Detection,"Yunhao Liang, Ruixuan Ying, Takuya Taniguchi, Guwen Lyu, Zhe Cui","Code clone detection is a critical task in software engineering, aimed at identifying duplicated or similar code fragments within or across software systems. Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence, particularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement identical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code semantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields suboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines LLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic clones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to filter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis. For pairs not identified as clones, the second stage employs an execution-based validation approach, utilizing LLM-generated test inputs to assess functional equivalence through cross-execution validation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to direct LLM-based detection, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in identifying semantic clones. Future work includes exploring cross-language clone detection and optimizing the framework for large-scale applications.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01357v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01357v1,cs.SE
An Empirical Validation of Open Source Repository Stability Metrics,"Elijah Kayode Adejumo, Brittany Johnson","Over the past few decades, open source software has been continuously integrated into software supply chains worldwide, drastically increasing reliance and dependence. Because of the role this software plays, it is important to understand ways to measure and promote its stability and potential for sustainability. Recent work proposed the use of control theory to understand repository stability and evaluate repositories' ability to return to equilibrium after a disturbance such as the introduction of a new feature request, a spike in bug reports, or even the influx or departure of contributors. This approach leverages commit frequency patterns, issue resolution rate, pull request merge rate, and community activity engagement to provide a Composite Stability Index (CSI). While this framework has theoretical foundations, there is no empirical validation of the CSI in practice. In this paper, we present the first empirical validation of the proposed CSI by experimenting with 100 highly ranked GitHub repositories. Our results suggest that (1) sampling weekly commit frequency pattern instead of daily is a more feasible measure of commit frequency stability across repositories and (2) improved statistical inferences (swapping mean with median), particularly with ascertaining resolution and review times in issues and pull request, improves the overall issue and pull request stability index. Drawing on our empirical dataset, we also derive data-driven half-width parameters that better align stability scores with real project behavior. These findings both confirm the viability of a control-theoretic lens on open-source health and provide concrete, evidence-backed applications for real-world project monitoring tools.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01358v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01358v1,cs.SE
Kronos: A Foundation Model for the Language of Financial Markets,"Yu Shi, Zongliang Fu, Shuo Chen, Bohan Zhao, Wei Xu, Changshui Zhang, Jian Li","The success of large-scale pre-training paradigm, exemplified by Large Language Models (LLMs), has inspired the development of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). However, their application to financial candlestick (K-line) data remains limited, often underperforming non-pre-trained architectures. Moreover, existing TSFMs often overlook crucial downstream tasks such as volatility prediction and synthetic data generation. To address these limitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework tailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized tokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences, preserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos using an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12 billion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced temporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting across a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts price series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the best non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility forecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line sequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation model for end-to-end financial time series analysis.

Who Gets Cited? Gender- and Majority-Bias in LLM-Driven Reference   Selection,Jiangen He,"Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research assistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation, yet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation workflows. This study systematically investigates gender bias in LLM-driven reference selection using controlled experiments with pseudonymous author names. We evaluate several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, and Claude Haiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and analyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of bias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group bias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool. These biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly attenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis indicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social sciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce or exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective mitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender disparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into high-stakes academic workflows.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02740v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02740v1,"cs.DL, cs.AI, cs.CY"

Our platform comprises an 8-inch quadcopter equipped with dual inverse five-bar linkage arrays for localized haptic actuation, an egocentric VR camera, and an exocentric top-down view. Visual inputs and language instructions are processed by a fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone - adapted via LoRA on a bespoke dataset of 450 multimodal scenarios - to output a 7-dimensional action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx, Hy, Hz, Hv). INT8 quantization and a high-performance server ensure real-time operation at 4-5 Hz. In human-robot interaction experiments (90 flights), VLH achieved a 56.7% success rate for target acquisition (mean reach time 21.3 s, pose error 0.24 m) and 100% accuracy in texture discrimination. Generalization tests yielded 70.0% (visual), 54.4% (motion), 40.0% (physical), and 35.0% (semantic) performance on novel tasks.

ConfGuard: A Simple and Effective Backdoor Detection for Large Language   Models,"Zihan Wang, Rui Zhang, Hongwei Li, Wenshu Fan, Wenbo Jiang, Qingchuan Zhao, Guowen Xu","Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs), where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs, thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation. Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR) in the vast majority of cases.

Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer for Intersection-Centric Next-Step   Prediction,"Zhehong Ren, Tianluo Zhang, Yiheng Lu, Yushen Liang, Promethee Spathis","Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph, thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17 percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01368v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01368v1,cs.AI

Deterministic Fault-Tolerant Local Load Balancing and its Applications   against Adaptive Adversaries,"Dariusz R. Kowalski, Jan Olkowski","Load balancing is among the basic primitives in distributed computing. In this paper, we consider this problem when executed locally on a network with nodes prone to failures. We show that there exist lightweight network topologies that are immune to message delivery failures incurred by (at most) a constant fraction of all nodes. More precisely, we design a novel deterministic fault-tolerant local load balancing (LLB) algorithm, which, similarly to their classical counterparts working in fault-free networks, has a relatively simple structure and guarantees exponentially fast convergence to the average value despite crash and omission failures.   As the second part of our contribution, we show three applications of the newly developed fault-tolerant local load balancing protocol. We give a randomized consensus algorithm, working against $t < n / 3$ crash failures, that improves over the best-known consensus solution by Hajiaghayi et al. with respect to communication complexity, yet with an arguable simpler technique of combining a randomly and locally selected virtual communication graph with a deterministic fault-tolerant local load balancing on this graph.   We also give a new solution for consensus for networks with omission failures. Our solution works against $t < \frac{n}{C\log{n} (\log\log n)^2}$ omissions, for some constant $C$, is nearly optimal in terms of time complexity, but most notably -- it has communication complexity $O((t^2 + n)\text{ polylog } {n})$, matching, within a polylogarithmic factor, the lower bound by Abraham et. al. with respect to both terms depending on $t$ and $n$.

To improve recommendation performance for cold-start and long-tail items, recent studies focus on leveraging item multimodal features to model users' interests. However, obtaining multimodal representations for items relies on complex pre-trained encoders, which incurs unacceptable computation cost to train jointly with downstream ranking models. Therefore, it is important to maintain alignment between semantic and behavior space in a lightweight way.   To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic-Behavior Alignment for Cold-start Recommendation framework, which mainly focuses on utilizing multimodal representations that align with the user behavior space to predict CTR. First, we leverage domain-specific knowledge to train a multimodal encoder to generate behavior-aware semantic representations. Second, we use residual quantized semantic ID to dynamically bridge the gap between multimodal representations and the ranking model, facilitating the continuous semantic-behavior alignment.

To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified 3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner. Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles.

The main innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression. During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores, filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model, supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01382v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01382v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
Lightweight Backbone Networks Only Require Adaptive Lightweight   Self-Attention Mechanisms,"Fengyun Li, Chao Zheng, Yangyang Fang, Jialiang Lan, Jianhua Liang, Luhao Zhang, Fa Si","Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms. Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT. Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO 2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is 5x that of MobileViT-X.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01385v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01385v1,cs.CV
Construction of Digital Terrain Maps from Multi-view Satellite Imagery   using Neural Volume Rendering,"Josef X. Biberstein, Guilherme Cavalheiro, Juyeop Han, Sertac Karaman","Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration, enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent, and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera intrinsics and extrinsics.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01386v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01386v1,cs.CV
"Video-based Vehicle Surveillance in the Wild: License Plate, Make, and   Model Recognition with Self Reflective Vision-Language Models","Pouya Parsa, Keya Li, Kara M. Kockelman, Seongjin Choi","Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints, occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery. This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of 91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01387v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01387v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
An Appraisal-Based Approach to Human-Centred Explanations,"Rukshani Somarathna, Madhawa Perera, Tom Gedeon, Matt Adcock","Explainability remains a critical challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly in high stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and decision support, where users must understand and trust automated reasoning. Traditional explainability methods such as feature importance and post-hoc justifications often fail to capture the cognitive processes that underlie human decision making, leading to either too technical or insufficiently meaningful explanations. We propose a novel appraisal based framework inspired by the Component Process Model (CPM) for explainability to address this gap. While CPM has traditionally been applied to emotion research, we use its appraisal component as a cognitive model for generating human aligned explanations. By structuring explanations around key appraisal dimensions such as relevance, implications, coping potential, and normative significance our framework provides context sensitive, cognitively meaningful justifications for AI decisions. This work introduces a new paradigm for generating intuitive, human-centred explanations in AI driven systems by bridging cognitive science and explainable AI.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01388v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01388v1,cs.HC
Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval: Finding People Through   Distinctive and Novel Attributes,"Minjeong Park, Hongbeen Park, Sangwon Lee, Yoonha Jang, Jinkyu Kim","Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval (OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues, regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories. Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.",2025-08-02,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01389v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01389v2,cs.CV
SpectrumFM: Redefining Spectrum Cognition via Foundation Modeling,"Chunyu Liu, Hao Zhang, Wei Wu, Fuhui Zhou, Qihui Wu, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Chan-Byoung Chae","The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification (WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.",2025-08-02,2025-08-10,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02742v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02742v2,"eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.LG"
"Recognising, Anticipating, and Mitigating LLM Pollution of Online   Behavioural Research","Raluca Rilla, Tobias Werner, Hiromu Yakura, Iyad Rahwan, Anne-Marie Nussberger","Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together, these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc, and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts. As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural research.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01390v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01390v1,"cs.CY, cs.AI"
Quenched large deviations for Monte Carlo integration with Coulomb gases,"Rémi Bardenet, Mylène Maïda, Martin Rouault","Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure $\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure, so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$. Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the \emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to $\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of the approximation of the potential.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01392v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01392v1,"cs.LG, math.PR, stat.ML, 65C05, 68W20, 60F10, 82B44, 82B31"
Via Score to Performance: Efficient Human-Controllable Long Song   Generation with Bar-Level Symbolic Notation,"Tongxi Wang, Yang Yu, Qing Wang, Junlang Qian","Song generation is regarded as the most challenging problem in music AIGC; nonetheless, existing approaches have yet to fully overcome four persistent limitations: controllability, generalizability, perceptual quality, and duration. We argue that these shortcomings stem primarily from the prevailing paradigm of attempting to learn music theory directly from raw audio, a task that remains prohibitively difficult for current models. To address this, we present Bar-level AI Composing Helper (BACH), the first model explicitly designed for song generation through human-editable symbolic scores. BACH introduces a tokenization strategy and a symbolic generative procedure tailored to hierarchical song structure. Consequently, it achieves substantial gains in the efficiency, duration, and perceptual quality of song generation. Experiments demonstrate that BACH, with a small model size, establishes a new SOTA among all publicly reported song generation systems, even surpassing commercial solutions such as Suno. Human evaluations further confirm its superiority across multiple subjective metrics.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01394v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01394v1,"cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS"
Effects of Feature Correlations on Associative Memory Capacity,"Stefan Bielmeier, Gerald Friedland","We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space. Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM, and might inspire more data-centric methods.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01395v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01395v1,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
Spatial-Frequency Aware for Object Detection in RAW Image,"Zhuohua Ye, Liming Zhang, Hongru Han","Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data (unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the ``spatialization"" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma parameters for the two domains.",2025-08-02,2025-08-06,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01396v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01396v2,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
Long-term resilience of online battle over vaccines and beyond,"Lucia Illari, Nicholas J. Restrepo, Neil F. Johnson","What has been the impact of the enormous amounts of time, effort and money spent promoting pro-vaccine science from pre-COVID-19 to now? We answer this using a unique mapping of online competition between pro- and anti-vaccination views among ~100M Facebook Page members, tracking 1,356 interconnected communities through platform interventions. Remarkably, the network's fundamental architecture shows no change: the isolation of established expertise and the symbiosis of anti and mainstream neutral communities persist. This means that even if the same time, effort and money continue to be spent, nothing will likely change. The reason for this resilience lies in ""glocal"" evolution: Communities blend multiple topics while bridging neighborhood-level to international scales, creating redundant pathways that transcend categorical targeting. The solution going forward is to focus on the system's network.

ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive.

The advent of powerful artificial intelligence models that can generate and analyze images creates new challenges for painting attribution. On the one hand, AI models can create images that mimic the style of a painter, which can be incorrectly attributed, for example, by other AI models. On the other hand, AI models may not be able to correctly identify the artist for real paintings, inducing users to incorrectly attribute paintings. In this paper, both problems are experimentally studied using state-of-the-art AI models for image generation and analysis on a large dataset with close to 40,000 paintings from 128 artists. The results show that vision language models have limited capabilities to: 1) perform canvas attribution and 2) to identify AI generated images.

The LMI approach can obtain the upper bound of transient energy growth that closely matches transient growth computed via the singular value decomposition of the state-transition matrix of linear time-varying systems. Our analysis captures that decelerating base flows exhibit significantly larger transient growth compared with accelerating flows.

Discovering Bias Associations through Open-Ended LLM Generations,"Jinhao Pan, Chahat Raj, Ziwei Zhu","Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at https://github.com/JP-25/Discover-Open-Ended-Generation",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01412v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01412v1,cs.CL

Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System (hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability.

Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting Using Machine Learning: Building   Intelligent Financial Prediction Models,"Md Zahidul Islam, Md Shafiqur Rahman, Md Sumsuzoha, Babul Sarker, Md Rafiqul Islam, Mahfuz Alam, Sanjib Kumar Shil","Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio (VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks, using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore, incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate forecasting models.

Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be different approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the problem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we tested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep autoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network traffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic logs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features. These models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the easiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different story. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user activity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of harmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a threat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw across the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex model. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data behaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine. But for messier, more subtle threats, we needed something more adaptive, sequence models and anomaly detectors, though they brought their trade offs. The takeaway here is clear in cybersecurity, context drives the solution.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01422v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01422v1,cs.CR
3DRot: 3D Rotation Augmentation for RGB-Based 3D Tasks,"Shitian Yang, Deyu Li, Xiaoke Jiang, Lei Zhang","RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics, object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7 to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is readily transferable to other 3D tasks.",2025-08-02,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01423v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01423v2,"cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.RO"

UniExtreme: A Universal Foundation Model for Extreme Weather Forecasting,"Hang Ni, Weijia Zhang, Hao Liu","Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation, and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network.

Capturing More: Learning Multi-Domain Representations for Robust Online   Handwriting Verification,"Peirong Zhang, Kai Ding, Lianwen Jin","In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches.

From Technical Excellence to Practical Adoption: Lessons Learned   Building an ML-Enhanced Trace Analysis Tool,"Kaveh Shahedi, Matthew Khouzam, Heng Li, Maxime Lamothe, Foutse Khomh","System tracing has become essential for understanding complex software behavior in modern systems, yet sophisticated trace analysis tools face significant adoption gaps in industrial settings. Through a year-long collaboration with Ericsson Montr\'eal, developing TMLL (Trace-Server Machine Learning Library, now in the Eclipse Foundation), we investigated barriers to trace analysis adoption. Contrary to assumptions about complexity or automation needs, practitioners struggled with translating expert knowledge into actionable insights, integrating analysis into their workflows, and trusting automated results they could not validate. We identified what we called the Excellence Paradox: technical excellence can actively impede adoption when conflicting with usability, transparency, and practitioner trust. TMLL addresses this through adoption-focused design that embeds expert knowledge in interfaces, provides transparent explanations, and enables incremental adoption. Validation through Ericsson's experts' feedback, Eclipse Foundation's integration, and a survey of 40 industry and academic professionals revealed consistent patterns: survey results showed that 77.5% prioritize quality and trust in results over technical sophistication, while 67.5% prefer semi-automated analysis with user control, findings supported by qualitative feedback from industrial collaboration and external peer review. Results validate three core principles: cognitive compatibility, embedded expertise, and transparency-based trust.

RMT-PPAD: Real-time Multi-task Learning for Panoptic Perception in   Autonomous Driving,"Jiayuan Wang, Q. M. Jonathan Wu, Katsuya Suto, Ning Zhang","Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6 FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD performance in practice.

TripTailor: A Real-World Benchmark for Personalized Travel Planning,"Yuanzhe Shen, Kaimin Wang, Changze Lv, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang","The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data, failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor, a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over 500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance. Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while generating practical itineraries.

Hyperspectral Image Recovery Constrained by Multi-Granularity Non-Local   Self-Similarity Priors,"Zhuoran Peng, Yiqing Shen","Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,   holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,   segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on   non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance. However,   these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local self-similarity   tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To address   this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition for the first   time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity non-local   self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs   coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local   self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition builds   upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural information of the   image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices. The   fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local detail   information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This   architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local, and non-local   priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong   applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of missing   scenes such as pixels and stripes.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01435v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01435v1,cs.CV
A Novel cVAE-Augmented Deep Learning Framework for Pan-Cancer RNA-Seq   Classification,Vinil Polepalli,"Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using 801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples (doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02743v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02743v1,"q-bio.GN, cs.AI, cs.LG"
Information Rates of Approximate Message Passing for Bandlimited   Direct-Detection Channels,"Daniel Plabst, Mohamed Akrout, Amine Mezghani, Gerhard Kramer","The capacity of bandlimited direct-detection channels is difficult to compute or approach because of the receiver nonlinearity. A generalized vector approximate message passing (GVAMP) detector is designed to achieve high rates with reasonable complexity. The rates increase by using multi-level coding and successive interference cancellation. The methods are applied to optical fiber channels with long intersymbol interference, as encountered in practice. Bipolar modulation operates within 0.3 bits per channel use (bpcu) of the real-alphabet coherent capacity for optically-amplified links, improving the best existing gap of 1 bpcu based on theory. Remarkably, bipolar modulation gains 6 decibels (dB) in power efficiency over unipolar modulation, and 3 dB for unamplified links. The detector is robust to changes in channel parameters such as the fiber length. The GVAMP complexity, measured in multiplications per information bit (mpib), is proportional to the number of iterations and the logarithm of the block length, and is substantially less than state-of-the-art neural networks. The receiver requires approximately 38 iterations to achieve a rate of 5 bpcu with 80 mpib.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01438v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01438v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"
Physically-based Lighting Augmentation for Robotic Manipulation,"Shutong Jin, Lezhong Wang, Ben Temming, Florian T.

To address this, we propose the first framework that leverages physically-based inverse rendering for lighting augmentation on real-world human demonstrations. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to render appearance changes under different lighting. To ensure consistent augmentation across each demonstration, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our framework by measuring the structural and temporal consistency of the augmented sequences, and by assessing its effectiveness in reducing the behavior cloning generalization gap (40.1%) on a 7-DoF robot across 6 lighting conditions using 720 real-world evaluations.

However, industrial platforms deploying multiple LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated validation and scaling.   Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits.

Nakamoto Consensus from Multiple Resources,"Mirza Ahad Baig, Christoph U. Günther, Krzysztof Pietrzak","The blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain record the amount of work W that went into creating them through proofs of work. When honest parties control a majority of the work, consensus is achieved by picking the chain with the highest recorded weight. Resources other than work have been considered to secure such longest-chain blockchains. In Chia, blocks record the amount of space S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a VDF).   In this paper, we ask what weight functions {\Gamma}(S,V,W) (that assign a weight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are secure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by honest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain is secure against private double-spending attacks.   We completely classify such functions in an idealized ""continuous"" model: {\Gamma}(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only if it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e., {\alpha}{\Gamma}(S,V,W)={\Gamma}(S,{\alpha}V, {\alpha}W). This includes Bitcoin rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W)=W and Chia rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W) = SV. In a more realistic model where blocks are created at discrete time-points, one additionally needs some mild assumptions on the dependency on S (basically, the weight should not grow too much if S is slightly increased, say linear as in Chia).   Our classification is more general and allows various instantiations of the same resource. It provides a powerful tool for designing new longest-chain blockchains. E.g., consider combining different PoWs to counter centralization, say the Bitcoin PoW W_1 and a memory-hard PoW W_2. Previous work suggested to use W_1+W_2 as weight. Our results show that using {\sqrt}(W_1){\cdot}{\sqrt}(W_2), {\min}{W_1,W_2} are also secure, and we argue that in practice these are much better choices.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01448v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01448v1,"cs.CR, cs.DC"
Towards Efficient Medical Reasoning with Minimal Fine-Tuning Data,"Xinlin Zhuang, Feilong Tang, Haolin Yang, Ming Hu, Huifa Li, Haochen Xue, Yichen Li, Junjun He, Zongyuan Ge, Ying Qian, Imran Razzak","Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However, existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data. Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over brute-force scaling.

"Think Broad, Act Narrow: CWE Identification with Multi-Agent Large   Language Models","Mohammed Sayagh, Mohammad Ghafari","Machine learning and Large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection has received significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art techniques show that LLMs are unsuccessful in even distinguishing the vulnerable function from its benign counterpart, due to three main problems: Vulnerability detection requires deep analysis, which LLMs often struggle with when making a one-shot prediction. Existing techniques typically perform function-level analysis, whereas effective vulnerability detection requires contextual information beyond the function scope. The focus on binary classification can result in identifying a vulnerability but associating it with the wrong security weaknesses (CWE), which may mislead developers. We propose a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address the challenges of identifying CWEs. This approach consists of three steps: (1) a team of LLM agents performs an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the function under review, (2) another team of agents identifies relevant external context to support or refute each candidate CWE, and (3) a final agent makes informed acceptance or rejection decisions for each CWE based on the gathered context. A preliminary evaluation of our approach shows promising results. In the PrimeVul dataset, Step 1 correctly identifies the appropriate CWE in 40.9\% of the studied vulnerable functions. We further evaluated the full pipeline on ten synthetic programs and found that incorporating context information significantly reduced false positives from 6 to 9 CWEs to just 1 to 2, while still correctly identifying the true CWE in 9 out of 10 cases.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01451v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01451v1,"cs.CR, cs.SE"
Kernel-Based Sparse Additive Nonlinear Model Structure Detection through   a Linearization Approach,"Sadegh Ebrahimkhani, John Lataire","The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01453v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01453v1,"eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.SY, stat.ML"
Regression Augmentation With Data-Driven Segmentation,"Shayan Alahyari, Shiva Mehdipour Ghobadlou, Mike Domaratzki","Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority) samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01455v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01455v1,cs.LG
Singular values of sparse random rectangular matrices: Emergence of   outliers at criticality,"Ioana Dumitriu, Hai-Xiao Wang, Zhichao Wang, Yizhe Zhu","Consider the random bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n, m, p)$, where each edge with one vertex in $V_{1}=[n]$ and the other vertex in $V_{2} =[m]$ is connected with probability $p$, and $n=\lfloor \gamma m\rfloor$ for a constant aspect ratio $\gamma \geq 1$. It is well known that the empirical spectral measure of its centered and normalized adjacency matrix converges to the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur (MP) distribution. However, largest and smallest singular values may not converge to the right and left edges, respectively, especially when $p = o(1)$. Notably, it was proved by Dumitriu and Zhu (2024) that there are almost surely no singular value outside the compact support of the MP law when $np = \omega(\log(n))$. In this paper, we consider the critical sparsity regime where $p = b\log(n)/\sqrt{mn}$ for some constant $b>0$. We quantitatively characterize the emergence of outlier singular values as follows. For explicit $b_{*}$ and $b^{*}$ as functions of $\gamma$, we prove that when $b > b_{*}$, there is no outlier outside the bulk; when $b^{*}< b < b_{*}$, outliers are present only outside the right edge of the MP law; and when $b < b^{*}$, outliers are present on both sides, all with high probability. Moreover, the locations of those outliers are precisely characterized by a function depending on the largest and smallest degree vertices of the random graph. We estimate the number of outliers as well. Our results follow the path forged by Alt, Ducatez and Knowles (2021), and can be extended to sparse random rectangular matrices with bounded entries.",2025-08-02,2025-08-29,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01456v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01456v2,"math.PR, cs.NA, math.CO, math.NA, math.ST, stat.TH"
Fast and scalable retrosynthetic planning with a transformer neural   network and speculative beam search,"Mikhail Andronov, Natalia Andronova, Michael Wand, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Djork-Arné Clevert","AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the same time constraints of several seconds.

Uncertainty-Aware Segmentation Quality Prediction via Deep Learning   Bayesian Modeling: Comprehensive Evaluation and Interpretation on Skin Cancer   and Liver Segmentation,"Sikha O K, Meritxell Riera-Marín, Adrian Galdran, Javier García Lopez, Julia Rodríguez-Comas, Gemma Piella, Miguel A. González Ballester","Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy, mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25 and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation, Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability, highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01460v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01460v1,cs.CV
Extended Interface Physics-Informed Neural Networks Method for Moving   Interface Problems,"Ran Bi, Weibing Deng, Yameng Zhu","Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful class of mesh-free numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly those involving complex geometries.

The proposed approach incorporates a level set function to characterize the interface, which can be obtained either directly or through a neural network solution. We conduct a rigorous a priori error analysis for the XI-PINN method, providing error bounds for the approximation. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we further demonstrate that XI-PINN achieves a faster training convergence rate compared to conventional PINN approaches.

Can3Tok: Canonical 3D Tokenization and Latent Modeling of Scene-Level 3D   Gaussians,"Quankai Gao, Iliyan Georgiev, Tuanfeng Y. Wang, Krishna Kumar Singh, Ulrich Neumann, Jae Shin Yoon","3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space, scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes, making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation tasks.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01464v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01464v1,cs.CV
EfficientGFormer: Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation via Pruned   Graph-Augmented Transformer,Fatemeh Ziaeetabar,"Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment. Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and graph-based baselines.

Bounded fuzzy logic control for optimal scheduling of green hydrogen   production and revenue maximisation,"Sleiman Farah, Jens Jakob Sørensen, Kary Främling, Matej Simurda","Hydrogen Purchase Agreements (HPAs) guarantee revenue streams that mitigate the financial risks inherent in the long-term production of green hydrogen from renewable energy sources. However, the intermittency of renewable electricity and the availability of parallel revenue opportunities in both the electricity and hydrogen markets complicate the scheduling of green hydrogen production. The scheduling should maximise the total revenue from short-term sales of electricity and hydrogen against the long-term HPA delivery obligations. This challenge is addressed by developing a Bounded Fuzzy Logic Control (BFLC) which determines the daily HPA delivery target based on day-ahead forecasts of electricity and hydrogen prices, as well as wind capacity factors. Subsequently, the daily target is imposed as a constraint in dispatch optimisation which allocates energy and hydrogen flows for each hour of the day. Revenue comparisons over several years demonstrate that the BFLC achieves total annual revenues within 9% of optimal revenues that are based on perfect foresight. The BFLC revenues consistently exceed those of steady control, with the largest differences observed under conditions of elevated price levels and variability. The BFLC provides an effective long-term scheduling of green hydrogen production, enabling realistic revenue quantification that mitigates economic risks without overlooking economically viable projects.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01468v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01468v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
VWAttacker: A Systematic Security Testing Framework for Voice over WiFi   User Equipments,"Imtiaz Karim, Hyunwoo Lee, Hassan Asghar, Kazi Samin Mubasshir, Seulgi Han, Mashroor Hasan Bhuiyan, Elisa Bertino","We present VWAttacker, the first systematic testing framework for analyzing the security of Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) User Equipment (UE) implementations. VWAttacker includes a complete VoWiFi network testbed that communicates with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) UEs based on a simple interface to test the behavior of diverse VoWiFi UE implementations; uses property-guided adversarial testing to uncover security issues in different UEs systematically. To reduce manual effort in extracting and testing properties, we introduce an LLM-based, semi-automatic, and scalable approach for property extraction and testcase (TC) generation. These TCs are systematically mutated by two domain-specific transformations. Furthermore, we introduce two deterministic oracles to detect property violations automatically. Coupled with these techniques, VWAttacker extracts 63 properties from 11 specifications, evaluates 1,116 testcases, and detects 13 issues in 21 UEs. The issues range from enforcing a DH shared secret to 0 to supporting weak algorithms. These issues result in attacks that expose the victim UE's identity or establish weak channels, thus severely hampering the security of cellular networks.

Directed Grammar-Based Test Generation,"Lukas Kirschner, Ezekiel Soremekun","To effectively test complex software, it is important to generate goal-specific inputs, i.e., inputs that achieve a specific testing goal. However, most state-of-the-art test generators are not designed to target specific goals. Notably, grammar-based test generators, which (randomly) produce syntactically valid inputs via an input specification (i.e., grammar) have a low probability of achieving an arbitrary testing goal. This work addresses this challenge by proposing an automated test generation approach (called FdLoop) which iteratively learns relevant input properties from existing inputs to drive the generation of goal-specific inputs. Given a testing goal, FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves and learn the input distribution of goal-specific test inputs via test feedback and a probabilistic grammar. We concretize FdLoop for four testing goals, namely unique code coverage, input-to-code complexity, program failures (exceptions) and long execution time. We evaluate FdLoop using three (3) well-known input formats (JSON, CSS and JavaScript) and 20 open-source software. In most (86%) settings, FdLoop outperforms all five tested baselines namely the baseline grammar-based test generators (random, probabilistic and inverse-probabilistic methods), EvoGFuzz and DynaMosa. FdLoop is (up to) twice (2X) as effective as the best baseline (EvoGFuzz) in inducing erroneous behaviors. In addition, we show that the main components of FdLoop (i.e., input mutator, grammar mutator and test feedbacks) contribute positively to its effectiveness. Finally, our evaluation demonstrates that FdLoop effectively achieves single testing goals (revealing erroneous behaviors, generating complex inputs, or inducing long execution time) and scales to multiple testing goals across varying parameter settings.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01472v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01472v1,"cs.SE, 68N99, D.2.5"
TreeDiff: AST-Guided Code Generation with Diffusion LLMs,"Yiming Zeng, Jinghan Cao, Zexin Li, Yiming Chen, Tao Ren, Dawei Xiang, Xidong Wu, Shangqian Gao, Tingting Yu","Recent advances in diffusion-based language models have opened new possibilities for controllable and bidirectional sequence generation. These models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based language models in code generation tasks.",2025-08-02,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01473v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01473v2,cs.CL
HT-Transformer: Event Sequences Classification by Accumulating Prefix   Information with History Tokens,"Ivan Karpukhin, Andrey Savchenko","Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data, including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series. Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks. However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context, which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks.

AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing training time due to reduced computational effort.

Reconstructing Trust Embeddings from Siamese Trust Scores: A Direct-Sum   Approach with Fixed-Point Semantics,"Faruk Alpay, Taylan Alpay, Bugra Kilictas","We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x 10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both devices and evaluation models.

However, the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations $\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection $\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically.

A Parallel Algorithm for Finding Robust Spanners in Large Social   Networks,"Arindam Khanda, Satyaki Roy, Prithwiraj Roy, Sajal K. Das","Social networks, characterized by community structures, often rely on nodes called structural hole spanners to facilitate inter-community information dissemination. However, the dynamic nature of these networks, where spanner nodes may be removed, necessitates resilient methods to maintain inter-community communication. To this end, we introduce robust spanners (RS) as nodes uniquely equipped to bridge communities despite disruptions, such as node or edge removals. We propose a novel scoring technique to identify RS nodes and present a parallel algorithm with a CUDA implementation for efficient RS detection in large networks. Empirical analysis of real-world social networks reveals that high-scoring nodes exhibit a spanning capacity comparable to those identified by benchmark spanner detection algorithms while offering superior robustness. Our implementation on Nvidia GPUs achieves an average speedup of 244X over traditional spanner detection techniques, demonstrating its efficacy to identify RS in large social networks.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01485v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01485v1,"cs.SI, cs.DC"

Despite its 96 million speaker base worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine Learning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources. This work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment classification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only provides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical requirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts covering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites and web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a custom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol for collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated rationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways: with rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales, for six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly, we curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate fairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a fairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental results suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy, reduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human reasoning.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01486v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01486v1,cs.CL
PESTO: Real-Time Pitch Estimation with Self-supervised   Transposition-equivariant Objective,"Alain Riou, Bernardo Torres, Ben Hayes, Stefan Lattner, Gaëtan Hadjeres, Gaël Richard, Geoffroy Peeters","In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition, we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective, eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets (MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time applications.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01488v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01488v1,"cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.LG, eess.AS"

Wagner, Manuel Tran, Fabian J Theis, Dieter Saur, Lorin Crawford, Tingying Peng","Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics.

The Homogenizing Effect of Large Language Models on Human Expression and   Thought,"Zhivar Sourati, Alireza S. Ziabari, Morteza Dehghani","Cognitive diversity, reflected in variations of language, perspective, and reasoning, is essential to creativity and collective intelligence. This diversity is rich and grounded in culture, history, and individual experience. Yet as large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in people's lives, they risk standardizing language and reasoning. This Review synthesizes evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how LLMs reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01491v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01491v1,cs.CL

As with any rapidly evolving ecosystem, there is a need for updated insights into how these tools are used in real-world projects. Building on the methodology established by the Wonderless dataset for serverless computing (and applying multiple new filtering steps), OpenLambdaVerse addresses this gap by creating a dataset of current GitHub repositories that use the Serverless Framework in applications that contain one or more AWS Lambda functions. We then analyze and characterize this dataset to get an understanding of the state-of-the-art in serverless architectures based on this stack. Through this analysis we gain important insights on the size and complexity of current applications, which languages and runtimes they employ, how are the functions triggered, the maturity of the projects, and their security practices (or lack of).

WinkTPG: An Execution Framework for Multi-Agent Path Finding Using   Temporal Reasoning,"Jingtian Yan, Stephen F. Smith, Jiaoyang Li","Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01495v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01495v1,cs.AI
ShrutiSense: Microtonal Modeling and Correction in Indian Classical   Music,"Rajarshi Ghosh, Jayanth Athipatla","Indian classical music relies on a sophisticated microtonal system of 22 shrutis (pitch intervals), which provides expressive nuance beyond the 12-tone equal temperament system. Existing symbolic music processing tools fail to account for these microtonal distinctions and culturally specific raga grammars that govern melodic movement. We present ShrutiSense, a comprehensive symbolic pitch processing system designed for Indian classical music, addressing two critical tasks: (1) correcting westernized or corrupted pitch sequences, and (2) completing melodic sequences with missing values. Our approach employs complementary models for different tasks: a Shruti-aware finite-state transducer (FST) that performs contextual corrections within the 22-shruti framework and a grammar-constrained Shruti hidden Markov model (GC-SHMM) that incorporates raga-specific transition rules for contextual completions. Comprehensive evaluation on simulated data across five ragas demonstrates that ShrutiSense (FST model) achieves 91.3% shruti classification accuracy for correction tasks, with example sequences showing 86.7-90.0% accuracy at corruption levels of 0.2 to 0.4. The system exhibits robust performance under pitch noise up to +/-50 cents, maintaining consistent accuracy across ragas (90.7-91.8%), thus preserving the cultural authenticity of Indian classical music expression.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01498v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01498v1,"cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS"
Req-Rec: Enhancing Requirements Elicitation for Increasing Stakeholder's   Satisfaction Using a Collaborative Filtering Based Recommender System,"Ali Fallahi, Amineh Amini, Azam Bastanfard, Hadi Saboohi","The success or failure of a project is highly related to recognizing the right stakeholders and accurately finding and discovering their requirements. However, choosing the proper elicitation technique was always a considerable challenge for efficient requirement engineering. As a consequence of the swift improvement of digital technologies since the past decade, recommender systems have become an efficient channel for making a deeply personalized interactive communication with stakeholders. In this research, a new method, called the Req-Rec (Requirements Recommender), is proposed. It is a hybrid recommender system based on the collaborative filtering approach and the repertory grid technique as the core component. The primary goal of Req-Rec is to increase stakeholder satisfaction by assisting them in the requirement elicitation phase. Based on the results, the method efficiently could overcome weaknesses of common requirement elicitation techniques, such as time limitation, location-based restrictions, and bias in requirements' elicitation process. Therefore, recommending related requirements assists stakeholders in becoming more aware of different aspects of the project.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01502v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01502v1,cs.IR

To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that combines Evidence-Centered Design with Social Cognitive Theory for adaptive scaffolding in LLM-based agents focused on STEM+C learning. We illustrate this framework with Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent that integrates human-AI hybrid intelligence and provides feedback grounded in cognitive science principles. Our findings show that Inquizzitor delivers high-quality assessment and interaction aligned with core learning theories, offering teachers effective guidance that students value.

Instruction-based Time Series Editing,"Jiaxing Qiu, Dongliang Guo, Brynne Sullivan, Teague R. Henry, Tom Hartvigsen","In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute- and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to unseen conditions through few-shot learning.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01504v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01504v1,cs.LG

In this paper, we focus on building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation model, specifically for GPU-powered devices.

FlashSVD: Memory-Efficient Inference with Streaming for Low-Rank Models,"Zishan Shao, Yixiao Wang, Qinsi Wang, Ting Jiang, Zhixu Du, Hancheng Ye, Danyang Zhuo, Yiran Chen, Hai Li","Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension, prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world, on-device deployments.   We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models. FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01506v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01506v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.PF"
Frequency-Constrained Learning for Long-Term Forecasting,"Menglin Kong, Vincent Zhihao Zheng, Lijun Sun","Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover, on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies, further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent periodic patterns.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01508v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01508v1,cs.LG
A Reward-Directed Diffusion Framework for Generative Design Optimization,"Hadi Keramati, Patrick Kirchen, Mohammed Hannan, Rajeev K. Jaiman","This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models (e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs, even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution, resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01509v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01509v1,"cs.LG, cs.CE"

This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees, were trained on both raw and engineered features.

End-to-End Personalization: Unifying Recommender Systems with Large   Language Models,"Danial Ebrat, Tina Aminian, Sepideh Ahmadian, Luis Rueda","Recommender systems are essential for guiding users through the vast and diverse landscape of digital content by delivering personalized and relevant suggestions. However, improving both personalization and interpretability remains a challenge, particularly in scenarios involving limited user feedback or heterogeneous item attributes. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid recommendation framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. LLMs are first used to enrich user and item representations by generating semantically meaningful profiles based on metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews. These enriched embeddings serve as initial node features in a user and movie bipartite graph, which is processed using a GAT based collaborative filtering model. To enhance ranking accuracy, we introduce a hybrid loss function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust negative sampling. Post-processing involves reranking the GAT-generated recommendations using the LLM, which also generates natural-language justifications to improve transparency. We evaluated our model on benchmark datasets, including MovieLens 100k and 1M, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that LLM-based embeddings and the cosine similarity term significantly contribute to performance gains. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of recommender systems.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01514v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01514v1,"cs.IR, cs.LG"

Classifying Epistemic Relationships in Human-AI Interaction: An   Exploratory Approach,"Shengnan Yang, Rongqian Ma","As AI systems become integral to knowledge-intensive work, questions arise not only about their functionality but also their epistemic roles in human-AI interaction. While HCI research has proposed various AI role typologies, it often overlooks how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors. This study examines how users form epistemic relationships with AI-how they assess, trust, and collaborate with it in research and teaching contexts. Based on 31 interviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook and identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic Abstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and human epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and context-dependent.

The Vanishing Gradient Problem for Stiff Neural Differential Equations,"Colby Fronk, Linda Petzold","Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness. Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is $O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural ODEs.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01519v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01519v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NA, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.NA"
Considering Spatial Structure of the Road Network in Pavement   Deterioration Modeling,"Lu Gao, Ke Yu, Pan Lu",Pavement deterioration modeling is important in providing information regarding the future state of the road network and in determining the needs of preventive maintenance or rehabilitation treatments. This research incorporated spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement performance modeling is the ability to easily and directly exploit the rich structural information in the network. This paper explored if considering spatial structure of the road network will improve the prediction performance of the deterioration models. The data used in this research comprises a large pavement condition data set with more than a half million observations taken from the Pavement Management Information System (PMIS) maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation. The promising comparison results indicates that pavement deterioration prediction models perform better when spatial relationship is considered.,2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02749v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02749v1,cs.LG
Unlocking Excellence: The Impact of Voucher Incentives on Cybersecurity   Education,"Jianhua Li, Shang Gao, Michelle Harvey, Trina Myers","While voucher incentives have been popular for primary and secondary schools, they are less used in higher education. In this study, we leverage industry voucher incentives to inspire students in cybersecurity education (CSE). We adopt a 100% portfolio-based assessment strategy, where students can freely select their target grades in the investigated unit. We purposely design one of the high distinction (HD) tasks to be obtaining an industry certificate and provide vouchers to those who can accomplish a predefined set of tasks before a midpoint. The voucher recipients will use the voucher to access the industry certificate training materials and sit the certificate exam for free. Passing the certificate exam is one of the conditions for gaining an HD grade. Our survey and interviews reveal a substantial influence of voucher incentives on students' career aspirations. In light of the findings, recommendations on adopting voucher incentives in CSE or broader ICT education are offered for institutions and researchers.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01520v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01520v1,"cs.HC, cs.CY"
Prototype Learning to Create Refined Interpretable Digital Phenotypes   from ECGs,"Sahil Sethi, David Chen, Michael C. Burkhart, Nipun Bhandari, Bashar Ramadan, Brett Beaulieu-Jones","Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data. While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes, trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions, NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original training objectives.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01521v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01521v1,cs.LG
Decentralized Aerial Manipulation of a Cable-Suspended Load using   Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Jack Zeng, Andreu Matoses Gimenez, Eugene Vinitsky, Javier Alonso-Mora, Sihao Sun","This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

Exploring Direct Instruction and Summary-Mediated Prompting in   LLM-Assisted Code Modification,"Ningzhi Tang, Emory Smith, Yu Huang, Collin McMillan, Toby Jia-Jun Li","This paper presents a study of using large language models (LLMs) in modifying existing code. While LLMs for generating code have been widely studied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although ""prompting"" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate intents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification introduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that natural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches have been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study investigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification: Direct Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in free-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by editing the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study with 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques across multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an iterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating outputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy presented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier to specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt scaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task goals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and code familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt interactions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code traceability, and consistency in generated summaries.",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01523v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01523v1,"cs.SE, cs.HC"
MiraGe: Multimodal Discriminative Representation Learning for   Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection,"Kuo Shi, Jie Lu, Shanshan Ye, Guangquan Zhang, Zhen Fang","Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection (MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability. Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even against unseen generators like Sora.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01525v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01525v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
DALEQ -- Explainable Equivalence for Java Bytecode,"Jens Dietrich, Behnaz Hassanshahi","The security of software builds has attracted increased attention in recent years in response to incidents like solarwinds and xz. Now, several companies including Oracle and Google rebuild open source projects in a secure environment and publish the resulting binaries through dedicated repositories. This practice enables direct comparison between these rebuilt binaries and the original ones produced by developers and published in repositories such as Maven Central. These binaries are often not bitwise identical; however, in most cases, the differences can be attributed to variations in the build environment, and the binaries can still be considered equivalent. Establishing such equivalence, however, is a labor-intensive and error-prone process.   While there are some tools that can be used for this purpose, they all fall short of providing provenance, i.e. readable explanation of why two binaries are equivalent, or not. To address this issue, we present daleq, a tool that disassembles Java byte code into a relational database, and can normalise this database by applying datalog rules. Those databases can then be used to infer equivalence between two classes. Notably, equivalence statements are accompanied with datalog proofs recording the normalisation process. We demonstrate the impact of daleq in an industrial context through a large-scale evaluation involving 2,714 pairs of jars, comprising 265,690 class pairs. In this evaluation, daleq is compared to two existing bytecode transformation tools. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in the manual effort required to assess non-bitwise equivalent artifacts, which would otherwise demand intensive human inspection. Furthermore, the results show that daleq outperforms existing tools by identifying more artifacts rebuilt from the same code as equivalent, even when no behavioral differences are present.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01530v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01530v1,cs.CR
Revisiting Gossip Protocols: A Vision for Emergent Coordination in   Agentic Multi-Agent Systems,"Mansura Habiba, Nafiul I. Khan","As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed toolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination. Today's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent messaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in enabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents continuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This paper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their fault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing layer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables scalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises unresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness, and consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new framework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a complementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical gaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could reshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around intent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a silver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient, reflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01531v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01531v1,"cs.MA, cs.AI"
ReasonAct: Progressive Training for Fine-Grained Video Reasoning in   Small Models,"Jiaxin Liu, Zhaolu Kang","While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks, small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%, 94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9, 15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines.

To establish clear connections between saddle dynamics and numerical methods of PDEs, as well as improving their compatibility, we first propose the continuous-in-space formulation of saddle dynamics for semilinear elliptic problems. This formulation yields a parabolic system that converges to saddle points. We then analyze the well-posedness, $H^1$ stability and error estimates of semi- and fully-discrete finite element schemes. Significant efforts are devoted to addressing the coupling, gradient nonlinearity, nonlocality of the proposed parabolic system, and the impacts of retraction due to the norm constraint.

Relative Completeness of Incorrectness Separation Logic,"Yeonseok Lee, Koji Nakazawa","Incorrectness Separation Logic (ISL) is a proof system that is tailored specifically to resolve problems of under-approximation in programs that manipulate heaps, and it primarily focuses on bug detection. This approach is different from the over-approximation methods that are used in traditional logics such as Hoare Logic or Separation Logic. Although the soundness of ISL has been established, its completeness remains unproven. In this study, we establish relative completeness by leveraging the expressiveness of the weakest postconditions; expressiveness is a factor that is critical to demonstrating relative completeness in Reverse Hoare Logic. In our ISL framework, we allow for infinite disjunctions in disjunctive normal forms, where each clause comprises finite symbolic heaps with existential quantifiers. To compute the weakest postconditions in ISL, we introduce a canonicalization that includes variable aliasing.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01535v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01535v1,cs.LO

However, we emphasize that global context integration is also essential for learning-based methods to stabilize complex fluid simulations. We propose the first Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with a local-global hierarchy, where continuous convolutions extract local features while self-attention captures global dependencies. This fusion suppresses the error accumulation and models long-range physical phenomena. Furthermore, we pioneer the first Transformer architecture specifically designed for continuous fluid simulation, seamlessly integrated within a dual-pipeline architecture. Our method establishes a new paradigm for neural fluid simulation by unifying convolution-based local features with attention-based global context modeling.

HALO: Human Preference Aligned Offline Reward Learning for Robot   Navigation,"Gershom Seneviratne, Jianyu An, Sahire Ellahy, Kasun Weerakoon, Mohamed Bashir Elnoor, Jonathan Deepak Kannan, Amogha Thalihalla Sunil, Dinesh Manocha","In this paper, we introduce HALO, a novel Offline Reward Learning algorithm that quantifies human intuition in navigation into a vision-based reward function for robot navigation. HALO learns a reward model from offline data, leveraging expert trajectories collected from mobile robots. During training, actions are uniformly sampled around a reference action and ranked using preference scores derived from a Boltzmann distribution centered on the preferred action, and shaped based on binary user feedback to intuitive navigation queries. The reward model is trained via the Plackett-Luce loss to align with these ranked preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO, we deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline learned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a model-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward as an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both learning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments on a Clearpath Husky across diverse scenarios demonstrate that policies trained with HALO generalize effectively to unseen environments and hardware setups not present in the training data.

MOPrompt: Multi-objective Semantic Evolution for Prompt Optimization,"Sara Câmara, Eduardo Luz, Valéria Carvalho, Ivan Meneghini, Gladston Moreira","Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs). Still, since manual prompt design is often complex, non-intuitive, and time-consuming, automatic prompt optimization has emerged as a research area. However, a significant challenge in prompt optimization is managing the inherent trade-off between task performance, such as accuracy, and context size. Most existing automated methods focus on a single objective, typically performance, thereby failing to explore the critical spectrum of efficiency and effectiveness. This paper introduces the MOPrompt, a novel Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) framework designed to optimize prompts for both accuracy and context size (measured in tokens) simultaneously.

Refine-n-Judge: Curating High-Quality Preference Chains for   LLM-Fine-Tuning,"Derin Cayir, Renjie Tao, Rashi Rungta, Kai Sun, Sean Chen, Haidar Khan, Minseok Kim, Julia Reinspach, Yue Liu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer. This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.   We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.

Getting out of the Big-Muddy: Escalation of Commitment in LLMs,"Emilio Barkett, Olivia Long, Paul Kröger","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment, where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor, multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500 trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment. However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3, N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates (46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions). These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.",2025-08-03,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01545v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01545v2,"cs.AI, cs.HC"
E-VRAG: Enhancing Long Video Understanding with Resource-Efficient   Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Zeyu Xu, Junkang Zhang, Qiang Wang, Yi Liu","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden. Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM. Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and accuracy for video RAG tasks.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01546v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01546v1,cs.CV

A Glimpse to Compress: Dynamic Visual Token Pruning for Large   Vision-Language Models,"Quan-Sheng Zeng, Yunheng Li, Qilong Wang, Peng-Tao Jiang, Zuxuan Wu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Qibin Hou","Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity, often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate.

Social Media Information Operations,"Tauhid Zaman, Yen-Shao Chen","The battlefield of information warfare has moved to online social networks, where influence campaigns operate at unprecedented speed and scale. As with any strategic domain, success requires understanding the terrain, modeling adversaries, and executing interventions. This tutorial introduces a formal optimization framework for social media information operations (IO), where the objective is to shape opinions through targeted actions. This framework is parameterized by quantities such as network structure, user opinions, and activity levels - all of which must be estimated or inferred from data. We discuss analytic tools that support this process, including centrality measures for identifying influential users, clustering algorithms for detecting community structure, and sentiment analysis for gauging public opinion. These tools either feed directly into the optimization pipeline or help defense analysts interpret the information environment. With the landscape mapped, we highlight threats such as coordinated bot networks, extremist recruitment, and viral misinformation. Countermeasures range from content-level interventions to mathematically optimized influence strategies. Finally, the emergence of generative AI transforms both offense and defense, democratizing persuasive capabilities while enabling scalable defenses. This shift calls for algorithmic innovation, policy reform, and ethical vigilance to protect the integrity of our digital public sphere.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01552v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01552v1,"cs.SI, cs.SY, eess.SY"
How Many Times Do People Usually Experience Different Kinds of Stressors   Each Day?,"Sameer Neupane, Mithun Saha, David M. Almeida, Santosh Kumar","Understanding how frequently people experience different kinds of daily stressors is crucial for interpreting stress exposure and informing mental health care. But it can't be directly estimated from current assessment methods, such as diaries, end-of-day interviews, and ecological momentary assessments (EMA), that use sparse sampling to limit participant burden, and a structured response format for uniformity. In this paper, we utilize stressor data collected in a 100-day field study with 68 participants that adopted wearable-triggered prompts and a freeform format to solicit stressors soon after they occurred, but limited its prompts to a small subset to keep the burden low. We develop asymptotic models to estimate the latent frequency of different kinds of real-life stressors that address sample sparsity and sampling bias. We find that people experience 5.39 stressors per day, on average. The top three are related to work (1.76/day), health (0.59/day), and transportation (0.55/day). These estimates offer a principled benchmark for interpreting individual stressor loads.

Are All Prompt Components Value-Neutral?

However, existing approaches often treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb. To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering.

MGCR-Net:Multimodal Graph-Conditioned Vision-Language Reconstruction   Network for Remote Sensing Change Detection,"Chengming Wang, Guodong Fan, Jinjiang Li, Min Gan, C. L. Philip Chen","With the advancement of remote sensing satellite technology and the rapid progress of deep learning, remote sensing change detection (RSCD) has become a key technique for regional monitoring. Traditional change detection (CD) methods and deep learning-based approaches have made significant contributions to change analysis and detection, however, many outstanding methods still face limitations in the exploration and application of multimodal data. To address this, we propose the multimodal graph-conditioned vision-language reconstruction network (MGCR-Net) to further explore the semantic interaction capabilities of multimodal data. Multimodal large language models (MLLM) have attracted widespread attention for their outstanding performance in computer vision, particularly due to their powerful visual-language understanding and dialogic interaction capabilities. Specifically, we design a MLLM-based optimization strategy to generate multimodal textual data from the original CD images, which serve as textual input to MGCR. Visual and textual features are extracted through a dual encoder framework. For the first time in the RSCD task, we introduce a multimodal graph-conditioned vision-language reconstruction mechanism, which is integrated with graph attention to construct a semantic graph-conditioned reconstruction module (SGCM), this module generates vision-language (VL) tokens through graph-based conditions and enables cross-dimensional interaction between visual and textual features via multihead attention. The reconstructed VL features are then deeply fused using the language vision transformer (LViT), achieving fine-grained feature alignment and high-level semantic interaction. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that MGCR achieves superior performance compared to mainstream CD methods.

However, why LMs suit tabular data preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition, integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline prospective pipelines.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01556v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01556v1,"cs.AI, 68T50, I.2.7"
Unsupervised Learning for the Elementary Shortest Path Problem,"Jingyi Chen, Xinyuan Zhang, Xinwu Qian","The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s to t that visits each vertex at most once.

The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and embedding the desired algorithmic alignment.

EvoVLMA: Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation,"Kun Ding, Ying Wang, Shiming Xiang","Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience. Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation (EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion, web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in recognition accuracy.

"What Makes ""Good"" Distractors for Object Hallucination Evaluation in   Large Vision-Language Models?","Ming-Kun Xie, Jia-Hao Xiao, Gang Niu, Lei Feng, Zhiqiang Kou, Min-Ling Zhang, Masashi Sugiyama","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains. Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs, significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities.

Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements, yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\""uchi automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.",2025-08-03,2025-08-20,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01561v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01561v3,cs.AI
Adaptive LiDAR Scanning: Harnessing Temporal Cues for Efficient 3D   Object Detection via Multi-Modal Fusion,"Sara Shoouri, Morteza Tavakoli Taba, Hun-Seok Kim","Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense, stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes. This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption, limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network, which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion methods with dense LiDAR scanning.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01562v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01562v1,cs.CV
Deeply Supervised Multi-Task Autoencoder for Biological Brain Age   estimation using three dimensional T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging,"Mehreen Kanwal, Yunsik Son","Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D) T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker for identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Effective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage comprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing spatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains challenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain structural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging trajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making sex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of predictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE employs deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at intermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and multitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our framework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary tasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively capturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction accuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark (OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves state-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups. Additionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component substantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of the overall architecture.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01565v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01565v1,"eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV"
LetheViT: Selective Machine Unlearning for Vision Transformers via   Attention-Guided Contrastive Learning,"Yujia Tong, Tian Zhang, Jingling Yuan, Yuze Wang, Chuang Hu","Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models. Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines.

The pursuer's goal is to capture the evader in the shortest time, while the evader attempts to delay the capture. We analyze two scenarios based on whether the capture can happen before the pursuer's speed reaches its maximum. For the case when the pursuer can capture the evader before its speed reaches its maximum, we use geometric methods to obtain the strategies for the pursuer and the evader. For the case when the pursuer cannot capture the evader before its speed reaches its maximum, we use numerical methods to obtain the strategies for the pursuer and the evader. In both cases, we demonstrate that the proposed strategies are optimal in the sense of Nash equilibrium through the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation, and the pursuer can capture the evader as long as as its maximum speed is larger than that of the evader.

KANMixer: Can KAN Serve as a New Modeling Core for Long-term Time Series   Forecasting?,"Lingyu Jiang, Yuping Wang, Yao Su, Shuo Xing, Wenjing Chen, Xin Zhang, Zhengzhong Tu, Ziming Zhang, Fangzhou Lin, Michael Zielewski, Kazunori D Yamada","In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures. Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance.

Harnessing Textual Semantic Priors for Knowledge Transfer and Refinement   in CLIP-Driven Continual Learning,"Lingfeng He, De Cheng, Huaijie Wang, Nannan Wang","Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored. During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation (SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier. Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.

Dynamic Clustering for Personalized Federated Learning on Heterogeneous   Edge Devices,"Heting Liu, Junzhe Huang, Fang He, Guohong Cao","Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data heterogeneity.

To address the challenge of estimating data heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs.

"Polymorphic Combinatorial Frameworks (PCF): Guiding the Design of   Mathematically-Grounded, Adaptive AI Agents","David Pearl, Matthew Murphy, James Intriligator","The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments. Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches, Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter values/variabilities.

Set Pivot Learning: Redefining Generalized Segmentation with Vision   Foundation Models,"Xinhui Li, Xinyu He, Qiming Hu, Xiaojie Guo","In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs, which is more suitable for current research and application requirements. Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii) VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness. Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01582v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01582v1,cs.CV
Adverse Weather-Independent Framework Towards Autonomous Driving   Perception through Temporal Correlation and Unfolded Regularization,"Wei-Bin Kou, Guangxu Zhu, Rongguang Ye, Jingreng Lei, Shuai Wang, Qingfeng Lin, Ming Tang, Yik-Chung Wu","Various adverse weather conditions such as fog and rain pose a significant challenge to autonomous driving (AD) perception tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, etc. The common domain adaption strategy is to minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather conditions. However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain in practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and performs poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse weather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model architecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is achieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of clear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition. Specifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential Mechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to achieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind arbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed to shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence to prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded Regularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather generalization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess the proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large margins.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01583v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01583v1,cs.RO

A Spatio-temporal Continuous Network for Stochastic 3D Human Motion   Prediction,"Hua Yu, Yaqing Hou, Xu Gui, Shanshan Feng, Dongsheng Zhou, Qiang Zhang","Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields, existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition, the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution (GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01585v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01585v1,cs.CV

In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and practical applications of DMs across future communication systems. We first provide an extensive tutorial of DMs and demonstrate how they can be applied to enhance optimizers, reinforcement learning and incentive mechanisms, which are popular approaches for problems in wireless networks.

Pr$^2$R: Information-Fused and Style-Aware Privacy-Preserving Replay for   Lifelong Person Re-Identification,"Mingyu Wang, Haojie Liu, Zhiyong Li, Wei Jiang","Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to fuse information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr$^2$R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the fused samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr$^2$R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.",2025-08-03,2025-08-25,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01587v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01587v2,cs.CV
Censored Sampling for Topology Design: Guiding Diffusion with Human   Preferences,"Euihyun Kim, Keun Park, Yeoneung Kim","Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling, our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator, guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy generative design.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01589v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01589v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, 74P05, 68T07"
A Plug-and-Play Multi-Criteria Guidance for Diverse In-Betweening Human   Motion Generation,"Hua Yu, Jiao Liu, Xu Gui, Melvin Wong, Yaqing Hou, Yew-Soon Ong","In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance. Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art methods in in-betweening motion generation task.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01590v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01590v1,"cs.GR, cs.CV"
Self-Navigated Residual Mamba for Universal Industrial Anomaly Detection,"Hanxi Li, Jingqi Wu, Lin Yuanbo Wu, Mingliang Li, Deyin Liu, Jialie Shen, Chunhua Shen","In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages ``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions. Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD, MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.",2025-08-03,2025-08-10,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01591v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01591v2,cs.CV
DMTrack: Spatio-Temporal Multimodal Tracking via Dual-Adapter,"Weihong Li, Shaohua Dong, Haonan Lu, Yanhao Zhang, Heng Fan, Libo Zhang","In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art results.

CLIMD: A Curriculum Learning Framework for Imbalanced Multimodal   Diagnosis,"Kai Han, Chongwen Lyu, Lele Ma, Chengxuan Qian, Siqi Ma, Zheng Pang, Jun Chen, Zhe Liu","Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios, due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis (CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis accuracy.

BeDKD: Backdoor Defense based on Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and   Directional Mapping Modulator,"Zhengxian Wu, Juan Wen, Wanli Peng, Yinghan Zhou, Changtong dou, Yiming Xue","Although existing backdoor defenses have gained success in mitigating backdoor attacks, they still face substantial challenges. In particular, most of them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but generally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently high attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Backdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial Knowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense effectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned data. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned data, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small set of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is designed to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a cycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean and identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream attacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD surpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without significantly reducing the CACC.

Why Heuristic Weighting Works: A Theoretical Analysis of Denoising Score   Matching,"Juyan Zhang, Rhys Newbury, Xinyang Zhang, Tin Tran, Dana Kulic, Michael Burke","Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution, a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity, can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01597v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01597v1,"cs.LG, stat.AP, stat.ML"
Drift-aware Collaborative Assistance Mixture of Experts for   Heterogeneous Multistream Learning,"En Yu, Jie Lu, Kun Wang, Xiaoyu Yang, Guangquan Zhang","Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts. Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially, collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient mechanism for online model capacity adaptation.

CLASS: Contrastive Learning via Action Sequence Supervision for Robot   Manipulation,"Sung-Wook Lee, Xuhui Kang, Brandon Yang, Yen-Ling Kuo","Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have led to strong performance in robotic manipulation, driven by expressive models, sequence modeling of actions, and large-scale demonstration data. However, BC faces significant challenges when applied to heterogeneous datasets, such as visual shift with different camera poses or object appearances, where performance degrades despite the benefits of learning at scale. This stems from BC's tendency to overfit individual demonstrations rather than capture shared structure, limiting generalization. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Learning via Action Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning behavioral representations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning. CLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with similarity-weighted positive pairs. We evaluate CLASS on 5 simulation benchmarks and 3 real-world tasks to achieve competitive results using retrieval-based control with representations only.

While some recent advances extend robust CBFs to unmatched disturbances, they heavily rely on differentiability property of disturbances, and fail to accommodate non-differentiable case for high-relative-degree safety constraints. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a class of disturbance rejection CBFs (DRCBFs), including DRCBFs and adaptive DRCBFs (aDRCBFs). This class of DRCBFs can strictly guarantee safety under general bounded disturbances, which includes both matched or unmatched, differentiable or non-differentiable disturbances as special cases.

Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces.

Towards Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection via Image-Adaptive   Prompt Learning,"Yiheng Li, Zichang Tan, Zhen Lei, Xu Zhou, Yang Yang","A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning. However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e., the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images.

Existing attack methods suffer from critical limitations: 1) they rely on unnatural adversarial prompts that lack human readability and require massive poisoned data; 2) their effectiveness is typically restricted to specific models, lacking generalizability; and 3) they can be mitigated by recent backdoor defenses.   To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel backdoor attack framework that achieves three key properties: 1) \emph{Practicality}: Our attack requires only a few stealthy backdoor samples to generate arbitrary attacker-chosen target images, as well as ensuring high-quality image generation in benign scenarios. 2) \emph{Generalizability:} The attack is applicable across multiple T2I DMs without requiring model-specific redesign. 3) \emph{Robustness:} The attack remains effective against existing backdoor defenses and adaptive defenses. Our extensive experimental results on multiple T2I DMs demonstrate that with only 10 carefully crafted backdoored samples, our attack method achieves $>$90\% attack success rate with negligible degradation in benign image generation quality.

From Pixels to Places: A Systematic Benchmark for Evaluating Image   Geolocalization Ability in Large Language Models,"Lingyao Li, Runlong Yu, Qikai Hu, Bowei Li, Min Deng, Yang Zhou, Xiaowei Jia","Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open- and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building geolocation-aware AI systems.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01608v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01608v1,cs.CV
Augmented Reinforcement Learning Framework For Enhancing Decision-Making   In Machine Learning Models Using External Agents,Sandesh Kumar Singh,"This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the priority of the ""Garbage-In, Garbage-Out"" problem that caused poor data inputs or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model, identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world scenario, which is ""Document Identification and Information Extraction"". This problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere. The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01612v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01612v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
TCDiff: Triplex Cascaded Diffusion for High-fidelity Multimodal EHRs   Generation with Incomplete Clinical Data,"Yandong Yan, Chenxi Li, Yu Huang, Dexuan Xu, Jiaqi Zhu, Zhongyan Chai, Huamin Zhang","The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs) remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data, formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion, Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking. Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate, while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees.

LLaDA-MedV: Exploring Large Language Diffusion Models for Biomedical   Image Understanding,"Xuanzhao Dong, Wenhui Zhu, Xiwen Chen, Zhipeng Wang, Peijie Qiu, Shao Tang, Xin Li, Yalin Wang","Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks: 84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the interplay between sampling steps and response repetition.

IMU: Influence-guided Machine Unlearning,"Xindi Fan, Jing Wu, Mingyi Zhou, Pengwei Liang, Dinh Phung","Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU), i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences. This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.",2025-08-03,2025-08-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01620v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01620v2,"cs.LG, cs.CR, cs.CV"
VFP: Variational Flow-Matching Policy for Multi-Modal Robot Manipulation,"Xuanran Zhai, Ce Hao","Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this, we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41 tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact model size.

In this work, we propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore, we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts for current task.

"OpenMed NER: Open-Source, Domain-Adapted State-of-the-Art Transformers   for Biomedical NER Across 12 Public Datasets",Maziyar Panahi,"Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced, publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes (PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12 established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01630v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01630v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Rate-distortion Optimized Point Cloud Preprocessing for Geometry-based   Point Cloud Compression,"Wanhao Ma, Wei Zhang, Shuai Wan, Fuzheng Yang","Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices. However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01633v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01633v1,"cs.CV, eess.IV"
Learning Unified System Representations for Microservice Tail Latency   Prediction,"Wenzhuo Qian, Hailiang Zhao, Tianlv Chen, Jiayi Chen, Ziqi Wang, Kingsum Chow, Shuiguang Deng","Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management. Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01635v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01635v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DC, cs.PF"
Privacy-Preserving Inference for Quantized BERT Models,"Tianpei Lu, Bingsheng Zhang, Lekun Peng, Bowen Zheng, Lichun Li, Kui Ren","With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services, ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$ speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to Gupta \emph{et al}.

Semantic Encryption: Secure and Effective Interaction with Cloud-based   Large Language Models via Semantic Transformation,"Dong Chen, Tong Yang, Feipeng Zhai, Pengpeng Ouyang, Qidong Liu, Yafei Li, Chong Fu, Mingliang Xu","The increasing adoption of Cloud-based Large Language Models (CLLMs) has raised significant concerns regarding data privacy during user interactions. While existing approaches primarily focus on encrypting sensitive information, they often overlook the logical structure of user inputs. This oversight can lead to reduced data utility and degraded performance of CLLMs. To address these limitations and enable secure yet effective interactions, we propose Semantic Encryption (SE)-a plug-and-play framework designed to preserve both privacy and utility. SE consists of two key components: Semantic Encoding and Semantic Decoding. In the encoding phase, a lightweight local model transforms the original user input into an alternative semantic context that maintains the original intent and logical structure while obfuscating sensitive information. This transformed input is then processed by the CLLM, which generates a response based on the transformed semantic context. To maintain a seamless user experience, the decoding phase will reconstruct the CLLM's response back into the original semantic context by referencing the locally stored user input. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SE effectively protects data privacy without compromising data utility or user experience, offering a practical solution for secure interaction with CLLMs. Particularly, the proposed SE demonstrates a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art InferDPT, surpassing it across various evaluated metrics and datasets.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01638v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01638v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI"

Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image   Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction,"Yujian Liu, Yuechuan Lin, Dongxu Shen, Haoran Li, Yutong Wang, Xiaoli Liu, Shidang Xu","Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches. This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over 10,000,000 patches.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01641v1,cs.CV

ChEmbed: Enhancing Chemical Literature Search Through Domain-Specific   Text Embeddings,"Ali Shiraee Kasmaee, Mohammad Khodadad, Mehdi Astaraki, Mohammad Arshi Saloot, Nicholas Sherck, Hamidreza Mahyar, Soheila Samiee","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in chemistry heavily depend on accurate and relevant retrieval of chemical literature. However, general-purpose text embedding models frequently fail to adequately represent complex chemical terminologies, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality. Specialized embedding models tailored to chemical literature retrieval have not yet been developed, leaving a substantial performance gap. To address this challenge, we introduce ChEmbed, a domain-adapted family of text embedding models fine-tuned on a dataset comprising chemistry-specific text from the PubChem, Semantic Scholar, and ChemRxiv corpora. To create effective training data, we employ large language models to synthetically generate queries, resulting in approximately 1.7 million high-quality query-passage pairs. Additionally, we augment the tokenizer by adding 900 chemically specialized tokens to previously unused slots, which significantly reduces the fragmentation of chemical entities, such as IUPAC names. ChEmbed also maintains a 8192-token context length, enabling the efficient retrieval of longer passages compared to many other open-source embedding models, which typically have a context length of 512 or 2048 tokens.

DRKF: Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion for Multimodal   Emotion Recognition,"Peiyuan Jiang, Yao Liu, Qiao Liu, Zongshun Zhang, Jiaye Yang, Lu Liu, Daibing Yao","Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify emotional states by integrating and analyzing information from multiple modalities. However, inherent modality heterogeneity and inconsistencies in emotional cues remain key challenges that hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose a Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF consists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module and a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual information estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to decouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features while mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight self-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality and integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused representation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality selection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion Discrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to retain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even if the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion Classification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging preserved inconsistency information. Experiments show that DRKF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and M3ED.

DUP: Detection-guided Unlearning for Backdoor Purification in Language   Models,"Man Hu, Yahui Ding, Yatao Yang, Liangyu Chen, Yanhao Jia, Shuai Zhao","As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does not require any external clean model.

"Towards EXPTIME One Way Functions: Bloom Filters, Succinct Graphs,   Cliques, & Self Masking",Shlomi Dolev,"Consider graphs of n nodes, and use a Bloom filter of length 2 log3 n bits. An edge between nodes i and j, with i < j, turns on a certain bit of the Bloom filter according to a hash function on i and j. Pick a set of log n nodes and turn on all the bits of the Bloom filter required for these log n nodes to form a clique. As a result, the Bloom filter implies the existence of certain other edges, those edges (x, y), with x < y, such that all the bits selected by applying the hash functions to x and y happen to have been turned on due to hashing the clique edges into the Bloom filter.   Constructing the graph consisting of the clique-selected edges and those edges mapped to the turned-on bits of the Bloom filter can be performed in polynomial time in n. Choosing a large enough polylogarithmic in n Bloom filter yields that the graph has only one clique of size log n, the planted clique. When the hash function is black-boxed, finding that clique is intractable and, therefore, inverting the function that maps log n nodes to a graph is not (likely to be) possible in polynomial time.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01649v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01649v1,"cs.CC, cs.CR, cs.DS"

While diffusion models can generate hairstyles from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness. Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to ensure consistency across granularity levels.

DAG: Unleash the Potential of Diffusion Model for Open-Vocabulary 3D   Affordance Grounding,"Hanqing Wang, Zhenhao Zhang, Kaiyang Ji, Mingyu Liu, Wenti Yin, Yuchao Chen, Zhirui Liu, Xiangyu Zeng, Tianxiang Gui, Hangxing Zhang","3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction, embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding.

MAP: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with   Map-Level Attention Processing,"Chenxi Li, Yichen Guo, Benfang Qian, Jinhao You, Kai Tang, Yaosong Du, Zonghao Zhang, Xiande Huang","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of the map-level decoding strategy.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01653v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01653v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"

While existing static analysis tools can detect simple obfuscation techniques like variable renaming and dead code injection, they fail against sophisticated deep obfuscation methods such as encrypted code with local or cloud-based decryption keys that completely destroy code structure and render traditional Abstract Syntax Tree analysis ineffective. To address these challenges, we present JSidentify-V2, a novel dynamic analysis framework that detects mini-game plagiarism by capturing memory invariants during program execution. Our key insight is that while obfuscation can severely distort static code characteristics, runtime memory behavior patterns remain relatively stable. JSidentify-V2 employs a four-stage pipeline: (1) static pre-analysis and instrumentation to identify potential memory invariants, (2) adaptive hot object slicing to maximize execution coverage of critical code segments, (3) Memory Dependency Graph construction to represent behavioral fingerprints resilient to obfuscation, and (4) graph-based similarity analysis for plagiarism detection.

Authorship Attribution in Multilingual Machine-Generated Texts,"Lucio La Cava, Dominik Macko, Róbert Móro, Ivan Srba, Andrea Tagarelli","As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA), i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages -- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01656v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01656v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.HC, physics.soc-ph"
From Contrast to Commonality: Audio Commonality Captioning for Enhanced   Audio-Text Cross-modal Understanding in Multimodal LLMs,"Yuhang Jia, Xu Zhang, Yong Qin","Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To further strengthen this alignment, recent works have proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained audio discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness in enabling difference-telling and detailed discrimination, ADC introduces a notable semantic gap between the input audios-often rich in diverse sound events-and the relatively brief, difference-focused output captions. This deviation from AC-style descriptions leads to a mismatch with the pretraining objective, resulting in catastrophic forgetting during finetuning. To mitigate this issue, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that encourages the model to capture the shared semantics across audio clips rather than emphasizing their detailed differences. Experimental results demonstrate that ACC not only effectively enhances audio-text understanding on primary captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music-related downstream tasks, such as vocal sound classification (VSC), speech emotion recognition (SER), musical instrument classification (MIC), and music genre classification (MGC), compared to ADC. These findings validate that ACC contributes to more robust cross-modal understanding and achieves a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in the context of MLLMs.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01659v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01659v1,"cs.SD, eess.AS"

"Single Point, Full Mask: Velocity-Guided Level Set Evolution for   End-to-End Amodal Segmentation","Zhixuan Li, Yujia Liu, Chen Hui, Weisi Lin","Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover, most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial level set function from image features and the point input, which then progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric modeling under weak guidance.

Shape Distribution Matters: Shape-specific Mixture-of-Experts for Amodal   Segmentation under Diverse Occlusions,"Zhixuan Li, Yujia Liu, Chen Hui, Jeonghaeng Lee, Sanghoon Lee, Weisi Lin","Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically, ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in occluded region segmentation.

In the online stage, these eigenfunctions are evaluated for new parameter realizations to construct the multiscale space. Furthermore, our approach addresses the complexity of multiple permeability fields with random inputs and multiple multiscale information, providing accurate and efficient approximations.

Rein++: Efficient Generalization and Adaptation for Semantic   Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models,"Zhixiang Wei, Xiaoxiao Ma, Ruishen Yan, Tao Tu, Huaian Chen, Jinjin Zheng, Yi Jin, Enhong Chen","Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios. Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable, instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g., daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g., nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of parameters.

We characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m (magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs, and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline models.

Boosting Generalization Performance in Model-Heterogeneous Federated   Learning Using Variational Transposed Convolution,"Ziru Niu, Hai Dong, A. K. Qin","Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server, including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and memory consumption",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01669v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01669v1,"cs.LG, cs.DC"

In reality, humans hold dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall.

However, traditional FL suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power, data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.

To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to 13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements.

Cure or Poison?

We propose Prompt-in-Image, a simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance, increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.

T-GRAG: A Dynamic GraphRAG Framework for Resolving Temporal Conflicts   and Redundancy in Knowledge Retrieval,"Dong Li, Yichen Niu, Ying Ai, Xiang Zou, Biqing Qi, Jianxing Liu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural language generation but remain limited in knowle-   dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic, temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.

However, existing token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM inference in resource constrained environments.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02751v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02751v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Generalized Kernelized Bandits: Self-Normalized Bernstein-Like   Dimension-Free Inequality and Regret Bounds,"Alberto Maria Metelli, Simone Drago, Marco Mussi","We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$ belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB, and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB, deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$, being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and $\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of both settings.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01681v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01681v1,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
The Bidirectional Process Reward Model,"Lingyin Zhang, Jun Gao, Xiaoxue Ren, Ziqiang Cao","Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning fine-grained scores to intermediate reasoning steps within a solution trajectory. However, existing PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R) evaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context, making it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later ones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation paradigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly incorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the conventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier ones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely through prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory, without any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures BiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies. We conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using samples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is evaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all settings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up to a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results highlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability, offering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01682v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01682v1,cs.CL
DisCo3D: Distilling Multi-View Consistency for 3D Scene Editing,"Yufeng Chi, Huimin Ma, Kafeng Wang, Jianmin Li","While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D}, a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing quality.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01684v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01684v1,cs.CV
Innovative tokenisation of structured data for LLM training,"Kayvan Karim, Hani Ragab Hassen. Hadj Batatia","Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel, hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset (CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient, processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured data.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01685v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01685v1,"cs.LG, cs.CR"
Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion   from Post-hoc Attributions,"Maciej Mozolewski, Szymon Bobek, Grzegorz J. Nalepa","Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR improves interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks.",2025-08-03,2025-08-12,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01687v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01687v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Voxlect: A Speech Foundation Model Benchmark for Modeling Dialects and   Regional Languages Around the Globe,"Tiantian Feng, Kevin Huang, Anfeng Xu, Xuan Shi, Thanathai Lertpetchpun, Jihwan Lee, Yoonjeong Lee, Dani Byrd, Shrikanth Narayanan","We present Voxlect, a novel benchmark for modeling dialects and regional languages worldwide using speech foundation models. Specifically, we report comprehensive benchmark evaluations on dialects and regional language varieties in English, Arabic, Mandarin and Cantonese, Tibetan, Indic languages, Thai, Spanish, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Italian. Our study used over 2 million training utterances from 30 publicly available speech corpora that are provided with dialectal information. We evaluate the performance of several widely used speech foundation models in classifying speech dialects. We assess the robustness of the dialectal models under noisy conditions and present an error analysis that highlights modeling results aligned with geographic continuity. In addition to benchmarking dialect classification, we demonstrate several downstream applications enabled by Voxlect. Specifically, we show that Voxlect can be applied to augment existing speech recognition datasets with dialect information, enabling a more detailed analysis of ASR performance across dialectal variations. Voxlect is also used as a tool to evaluate the performance of speech generation systems.

Closed-Circuit Television Data as an Emergent Data Source for Urban Rail   Platform Crowding Estimation,"Riccardo Fiorista, Awad Abdelhalim, Anson F. Stewart, Gabriel L. Pincus, Ian Thistle, Jinhua Zhao","Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate, real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus, for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data, independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03749v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03749v1,"cs.CV, eess.IV"
SURE-Med: Systematic Uncertainty Reduction for Enhanced Reliability in   Medical Report Generation,"Yuhang Gu, Xingyu Hu, Yuyu Fan, Xulin Yan, Longhuan Xu, Peng peng","Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty, caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction. Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions. Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports, often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical decision support.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01693v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01693v1,"cs.AI, cs.CV"
Performance and Storage Analysis of CRYSTALS Kyber as a Post Quantum   Replacement for RSA and ECC,"Nicolas Rodriguez-Alvarez, Fernando Rodriguez-Merino","The steady advancement in quantum computer error correction technology has pushed the current record to 48 stable logical qubits, bringing us closer to machines capable of running Shor's algorithm at scales that threaten RSA and ECC cryptography. While the timeline for developing such quantum computers remains uncertain, the cryptographic community must prepare for the transition to quantum-resistant algorithms. CRYSTALS-Kyber, standardized by NIST in 2022, represents a leading post-quantum cryptographic solution, but widespread adoption faces significant challenges. If this migration follows patterns similar to the SHA-1 to SHA-2 transition, organizations may experience prolonged periods of vulnerability, with substantial security and economic consequences. This study evaluates Kyber's practical viability through performance testing across various implementation schemes, utilizing only standard built-in processor acceleration features, some of which include AES-NI and ASIMD, without any specialized hardware additions. Our findings demonstrate that Kyber provides robust security guarantees against quantum attacks while maintaining acceptable performance profiles for most contemporary applications, utilizing only commodity hardware with manufacturer-provided acceleration capabilities.",2025-08-03,2025-08-30,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01694v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01694v5,"cs.CR, cs.PF"
DexReMoE:In-hand Reorientation of General Object via Mixtures of Experts,"Jun Wan, Xing Liu, Yunlong Dong","In hand object reorientation provides capability for dexterous manipulation, requiring robust control policies to manage diverse object geometries, maintain stable grasps, and execute precise complex orientation trajectories. However, prior works focus on single objects or simple geometries and struggle to generalize to complex shapes. In this work, we introduce DexReMoE (Dexterous Reorientation Mixture-of-Experts), in which multiple expert policies are trained for different complex shapes and integrated within a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, making the approach capable of generalizing across a wide range of objects. Additionally, we incorporate object category information as privileged inputs to enhance shape representation. Our framework is trained in simulation using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluated on novel out-of-distribution objects in the most challenging scenario of reorienting objects held in the air by a downward-facing hand. In terms of the average consecutive success count, DexReMoE achieves a score of 19.5 across a diverse set of 150 objects. In comparison to the baselines, it also enhances the worst-case performance, increasing it from 0.69 to 6.05.

Collaborative Chain-of-Agents for Parametric-Retrieved Knowledge Synergy,"Yi Jiang, Sendong Zhao, Jianbo Li, Haochun Wang, Lizhe Zhang, Yan Liu, Bing Qin","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.",2025-08-03,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01696v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01696v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
"Register Anything: Estimating ""Corresponding Prompts"" for Segment   Anything Model","Shiqi Huang, Tingfa Xu, Wen Yan, Dean Barratt, Yipeng Hu","Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images. In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly ""searching for corresponding prompts"", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models (e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we introduce the ""corresponding prompt problem"", which aims to identify a corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X, such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an ""inverse prompt"" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts, inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and, as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01697v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01697v1,cs.CV

However, generating smooth and rational transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition tasks: concept blending and scene transition.

TimeExpert: An Expert-Guided Video LLM for Video Temporal Grounding,"Zuhao Yang, Yingchen Yu, Yunqing Zhao, Shijian Lu, Song Bai","Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this, we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens (e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.

DeepVIS: Bridging Natural Language and Data Visualization Through   Step-wise Reasoning,"Zhihao Shuai, Boyan Li, Siyu Yan, Yuyu Luo, Weikai Yang","Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors, and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes.

A theoretical framework for systematic FCCs to channels matched to the Lee metric has been studied recently, which introduced function-correcting Lee codes (FCLCs) and also derived upper and lower bounds on their optimal redundancy. In this paper, we first propose a Plotkin-like bound for irregular Lee-distance codes. We then construct explicit FCLCs for specific classes of functions, including the Lee weight, Lee weight distribution, modular sum, and locally bounded function. For these functions, lower bounds on redundancy are obtained, and our constructions are shown to be optimal in certain cases.

LT-Gaussian: Long-Term Map Update Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for   Autonomous Driving,"Luqi Cheng, Zhangshuo Qi, Zijie Zhou, Chao Lu, Guangming Xiong","Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components: Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently, during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios.

Schuller","Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP) skills such as through next-token prediction and self-attention, but their ability to integrate broad context also makes them prone to incorporating irrelevant information. Prior work has focused on semantic leakage, bias introduced by semantically irrelevant context. In this paper, we introduce expression leakage, a novel phenomenon where LLMs systematically generate sentimentally charged expressions that are semantically unrelated to the input context. To analyse the expression leakage, we collect a benchmark dataset along with a scheme to automatically generate a dataset from free-form text from common-crawl. In addition, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline that correlates well with human judgment, which accelerates the benchmarking by decoupling from the need of annotation for each analysed model. Our experiments show that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage reduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that expression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building process, and cannot be mitigated by prompting.

RWA Liquidity Challenges and   the Road Ahead",Rischan Mafrur,"The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) promises to transform financial markets by enabling fractional ownership, global accessibility, and programmable settlement of traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate, private credit, and government bonds. While technical progress has been rapid, with over \$25 billion in tokenized RWAs brought on-chain as of 2025, liquidity remains a critical bottleneck. This paper investigates the gap between tokenization and tradability, drawing on recent academic research and market data from platforms such as RWA.xyz. We document that most RWA tokens exhibit low trading volumes, long holding periods, and limited investor participation, despite their potential for 24/7 global markets. Through case studies of tokenized real estate, private credit, and tokenized treasury funds, we present empirical liquidity observations that reveal low transfer activity, limited active address counts, and minimal secondary trading for most tokenized asset classes. Next, we categorize the structural barriers to liquidity, including regulatory gating, custodial concentration, whitelisting, valuation opacity, and lack of decentralized trading venues. Finally, we propose actionable pathways to improve liquidity, ranging from hybrid market structures and collateral-based liquidity to transparency enhancements and compliance innovation.

This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.",2025-08-03,2025-08-25,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01710v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01710v2,"cs.CL, cs.LG"
GAID: Frame-Level Gated Audio-Visual Integration with Directional   Perturbation for Text-Video Retrieval,"Bowen Yang, Yun Cao, Chen He, Xiaosu Su","Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID, a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and (ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations. Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency gains.

Dynamic Robot-Assisted Surgery with Hierarchical Class-Incremental   Semantic Segmentation,"Julia Hindel, Ema Mekic, Enamundram Naga Karthik, Rohit Mohan, Daniele Cattaneo, Maria Kalweit, Abhinav Valada","Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments.

A Provably Secure Network Protocol for Private Communication with   Analysis and Tracing Resistance,"Chao Ge, Wei Yuan, Ge Chen, Yanbin Pan, Yuan Shen","Anonymous communication networks have emerged as crucial tools for obfuscating communication pathways and concealing user identities. However, their practical deployments face significant challenges, including susceptibility to artificial intelligence (AI)-powered metadata analysis, difficulties in decentralized architectures, and the absence of provable security guarantees. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel decentralized anonymous routing protocol with resistance to tracing and traffic analysis. The protocol eliminates dependencies on the threshold model and trusted third-party setups, ensuring indistinguishable identity privacy even in highly adversarial environments. Different from traditional empirical security analysis of anonymous networks, this paper rigorously proves indistinguishable identity privacy for users even in extremely adversarial environments. Furthermore, simulations confirm its practical feasibility, demonstrating both security and efficiency.

Neural Policy Iteration for Stochastic Optimal Control: A   Physics-Informed Approach,"Yeongjong Kim, Yeoneung Kim, Minseok Kim, Namkyeong Cho","We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI) framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings, inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01718v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01718v1,"cs.LG, cs.CE, cs.NA, math.NA, 93E20, 35Q93, 68T07, 65N21"

OpenMap: Instruction Grounding via Open-Vocabulary Visual-Language   Mapping,"Danyang Li, Zenghui Yang, Guangpeng Qi, Songtao Pang, Guangyong Shang, Qiang Ma, Zheng Yang","Grounding natural language instructions to visual observations is fundamental for embodied agents operating in open-world environments. Recent advances in visual-language mapping have enabled generalizable semantic representations by leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). However, these methods often fall short in aligning free-form language commands with specific scene instances, due to limitations in both instance-level semantic consistency and instruction interpretation. We present OpenMap, a zero-shot open-vocabulary visual-language map designed for accurate instruction grounding in navigation tasks. To address semantic inconsistencies across views, we introduce a Structural-Semantic Consensus constraint that jointly considers global geometric structure and vision-language similarity to guide robust 3D instance-level aggregation. To improve instruction interpretation, we propose an LLM-assisted Instruction-to-Instance Grounding module that enables fine-grained instance selection by incorporating spatial context and expressive target descriptions. We evaluate OpenMap on ScanNet200 and Matterport3D, covering both semantic mapping and instruction-to-target retrieval tasks.

ReflecSched: Solving Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling via   LLM-Powered Hierarchical Reflection,"Shijie Cao, Yuan Yuan","Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified pitfalls.

We present CcGAN-AVAR, an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training.

Student-AI interactions were qualitatively coded and analyzed with transition network analysis, sequence analysis and partial correlation networks as well as comparison of frequencies using chi-square and Person-residual shaded Mosaic plots to map interaction patterns, their evolution, and their relationship to problem complexity and student performance. Findings reveal a dominant Instructive pattern with interactions characterized by iterative ordering rather than collaborative negotiation. Oftentimes, students engaged in long threads that showed misalignment between their prompts and AI output that exemplified a lack of synergy that challenges the prevailing assumptions about LLMs as collaborative partners. We also found no significant correlations between assignment complexity, prompt length, and student grades suggesting a lack of cognitive depth, or effect of problem difficulty.

OccamVTS: Distilling Vision Models to 1% Parameters for Time Series   Forecasting,"Sisuo Lyu, Siru Zhong, Weilin Ruan, Qingxiang Liu, Qingsong Wen, Hui Xiong, Yuxuan Liang","Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01727v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01727v1,"cs.LG, cs.CV"

To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound, concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level.

Tracking the Unstable: Appearance-Guided Motion Modeling for Robust   Multi-Object Tracking in UAV-Captured Videos,"Jianbo Ma, Hui Luo, Qi Chen, Yuankai Qi, Yumei Sun, Amin Beheshti, Jianlin Zhang, Ming-Hsuan Yang","Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections.

SpectralX: Parameter-efficient Domain Generalization for Spectral Remote   Sensing Foundation Models,"Yuxiang Zhang, Wei Li, Mengmeng Zhang, Jiawei Han, Ran Tao, Shunlin Liang","Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions. Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA) that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from new regions or seasons.

Topolow: Force-Directed Euclidean Embedding of Dissimilarity Data with   Robustness Against Non-Metricity and Sparsity,"Omid Arhami, Pejman Rohani","The problem of embedding a set of objects into a low-dimensional Euclidean space based on a matrix of pairwise dissimilarities is fundamental in data analysis, machine learning, and statistics. However, the assumptions of many standard analytical methods are violated when the input dissimilarities fail to satisfy metric or Euclidean axioms. We present the mathematical and statistical foundations of Topolow, a physics-inspired, gradient-free optimization framework for such embedding problems. Topolow is conceptually related to force-directed graph drawing algorithms but is fundamentally distinguished by its goal of quantitative metric reconstruction. It models objects as particles in a physical system, and its novel optimization scheme proceeds through sequential, stochastic pairwise interactions, which circumvents the need to compute a global gradient and provides robustness against convergence to local optima, especially for sparse data. Topolow maximizes the likelihood under a Laplace error model, robust to outliers and heterogeneous errors, and properly handles censored data. Crucially, Topolow does not require the input dissimilarities to be metric, making it a robust solution for embedding non-metric measurements into a valid Euclidean space, thereby enabling the use of standard analytical tools. We demonstrate the superior performance of Topolow compared to standard Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) methods in reconstructing the geometry of sparse and non-Euclidean data. This paper formalizes the algorithm, first introduced as Topolow in the context of antigenic mapping in (Arhami and Rohani, 2025) (open access), with emphasis on its metric embedding and mathematical properties for a broader audience.

Difficulty Generating Factors for Context-free Language Construction   Assignments,"Florian Schmalstieg, Marko Schmellenkamp, Jakob Schwerter, Thomas Zeume","Computer science students often struggle with abstract theoretical concepts, particularly in introductory courses on theoretical computer science. One such challenge is understanding context-free languages and their various representations.   In this study we investigate factors that influence the difficulty of constructing context-free grammars and pushdown automata for context-free languages. We propose two potential difficulty generating factors targeting how a language is presented to students: representation in natural language and as a verbose set notation. Furthermore, we propose two factors targeting the structure of the given context-free language: nesting of constructs and insertion of multiplicities.   We conducted a controlled experiment using within-subject randomization in an interactive learning system, testing the proposed difficulty factors for constructing context-free grammars and pushdown automata. Our results suggest that three of the four factors significantly influence students' objective performance in solving exercises for constructing context-free grammars, while students' perceived difficulties only partly align with the objective performance measures. The findings for pushdown automata tasks differed markedly from those for context-free grammar tasks. Our variations either had negligible effects or, in some cases, even reduced difficulty. Thus, no robust statistical conclusions can be made for pushdown automata tasks.

Enhancing the Preference Extractor in Multi-turn Dialogues: From   Annotating Disasters to Accurate Preference Extraction,"Cheng Wang, ziru Liu, Pengcheng Tang, Mingyu Zhang, Quanyu Dai, Yue Zhu","Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is a pivotal aspect of providing satisfying services. Current research shows that using large language models (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields excellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary challenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled multi-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions across turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual consistency maintenance for annotators (termed \textbf{``Annotating Disaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in sequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn preference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn extraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework named \textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes the dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn dialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves annotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue dataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target preference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and their corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental results indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new dialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn dialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with a win rate of 28.4\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01739v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01739v1,cs.CL

In this paper, we introduce AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions, but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate instance-level Gaussian selection.

Simulated Ensemble Attack: Transferring Jailbreaks Across Fine-tuned   Vision-Language Models,"Ruofan Wang, Xin Wang, Yang Yao, Xuan Tong, Xingjun Ma","Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack (SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across the entire model lifecycle.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01741v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01741v1,cs.CV

Examining the Effects of Human-Likeness of Avatars on Emotion Perception   and Emotion Elicitation,"Shiyao Zhang, Omar Faruk, Robert Porzel, Dennis Küster, Tanja Schultz, Hui Liu","An increasing number of online interaction settings now provide the possibility to visually represent oneself via an animated avatar instead of a video stream. Benefits include protecting the communicator's privacy while still providing a means to express their individuality. In consequence, there has been a surge in means for avatar-based personalization, ranging from classic human representations to animals, food items, and more. However, using avatars also has drawbacks. Depending on the human-likeness of the avatar and the corresponding disparities between the avatar and the original expresser, avatars may elicit discomfort or even hinder effective nonverbal communication by distorting emotion perception. This study examines the relationship between the human-likeness of virtual avatars and emotion perception for Ekman's six ""basic emotions"". Research reveals that avatars with varying degrees of human-likeness have distinct effects on emotion perception. High human-likeness avatars, such as human avatars, tend to elicit more negative emotional responses from users, a phenomenon that is consistent with the concept of Uncanny Valley in aesthetics, which suggests that closely resembling humans can provoke negative emotional responses. Conversely, a raccoon avatar and a shark avatar, known as cuteness, which exhibit moderate human similarity in this study, demonstrate a positive influence on emotion perception. Our initial results suggest that the human-likeness of avatars is an important factor for emotion perception. The results from the follow-up study further suggest that the cuteness of avatars and their natural facial status may also play a significant role in emotion perception and elicitation. We discuss practical implications for strategically conveying specific human behavioral messages through avatars in multiple applications, such as business and counseling.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01743v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01743v1,cs.HC
AGFT: An Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner for Real-Time LLM Inference   Optimization,"Zicong Ye, Kunming Zhang, Guoming Tang","The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust, automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01744v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01744v1,cs.LG
"Energy-Efficient Federated Learning for Edge Real-Time Vision via Joint   Data, Computation, and Communication Design","Xiangwang Hou, Jingjing Wang, Fangming Guan, Jun Du, Chunxiao Jiang, Yong Ren","Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning (FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control. We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio, quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions. Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior convergence speed and energy efficiency.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01745v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01745v1,"cs.LG, cs.DC"
Bayes-Entropy Collaborative Driven Agents for Research Hypotheses   Generation and Optimization,"Shiyang Duan, Yuan Tian, Qi Bing, Xiaowei Shao","The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes' theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12 optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases significantly by 0.92.

DMSC: Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework for Time Series   Forecasting,"Haonan Yang, Jianchao Tang, Zhuo Li, Long Lan","Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks.

Towards Faster Feasible Matrix Multiplication by Trilinear Aggregation,"Oded Schwartz, Eyal Zwecher","Matrix multiplication is a fundamental kernel in high performance computing. Many algorithms for fast matrix multiplication can only be applied to enormous matrices ($n>10^{100}$) and thus cannot be used in practice. Of all algorithms applicable to feasible input, Pan's $O(n^{2.773372})$ algorithm (1982) is asymptotically the fastest. We obtain an $O(n^{2.773203})$ algorithm applicable to the same input sizes as Pan's algorithm. This algorithm is the fastest matrix multiplication algorithm with base case smaller than $1000$. Further, our method obtains the best asymptotic complexity for many small base cases, starting at $n_0=28$. We also obtain better exponents for larger base cases. To construct our algorithm, we use the trilinear aggregation method. We find parts of the algorithms that are equivalent to matrix multiplication with smaller base case, and use the de Groote equivalence to replace these parts in a way that allows further optimization of our algorithms. Finally, we improve the additive complexity of our algorithms by finding a sparse decomposition and reducing the leading coefficient. These mark a fundamental step towards outperforming existing fast matrix multiplication algorithms in practice.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01748v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01748v1,cs.DS
Improving Noise Efficiency in Privacy-preserving Dataset Distillation,"Runkai Zheng, Vishnu Asutosh Dasu, Yinong Oliver Wang, Haohan Wang, Fernando De la Torre","Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns. Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation, Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with 50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth} the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01749v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01749v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
LLM-Assisted Model-Based Fuzzing of Protocol Implementations,"Changze Huang, Di Wang, Zhi Quan Zhou","Testing network protocol implementations is critical for ensuring the reliability, security, and interoperability of distributed systems. Faults in protocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially in real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol testing involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state transitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such models typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort, making the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse protocols and implementations.   We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations. Our approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from which the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this state-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences of states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator. The sequences generator then generates test inputs to call the protocol implementation under various conditions. We evaluated our approach on three widely used network protocol implementations and successfully identified 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities. We have reported them to the respective developers for confirmation. This demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our LLM-assisted fuzzing framework in uncovering real-world security issues.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01750v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01750v1,"cs.CR, cs.SE"
Implementing Cumulative Functions with Generalized Cumulative   Constraints,"Pierre Schaus, Charles Thomas, Roger Kameugne","Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers. However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and effectively scales to large problems.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01751v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01751v1,cs.AI
Vision transformer-based multi-camera multi-object tracking framework   for dairy cow monitoring,"Kumail Abbas, Zeeshan Afzal, Aqeel Raza, Taha Mansouri, Andrew W. Dowsey, Chaidate Inchaisri, Ali Alameer","Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory. Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex interior surroundings in real time, according to our data.

AI-Generated Text is Non-Stationary: Detection via Temporal Tomography,"Alva West, Yixuan Weng, Minjun Zhu, Luodan Zhang, Zhen Lin, Guangsheng Bao, Yue Zhang","The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur. Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT), a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark, TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with 14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\% computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal dynamics is essential for robust detection.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01754v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01754v1,cs.CL

The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy, improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion.

Causality and Decision-making: A Logical Framework for Systems and   Security Modelling,"Pinaki Chakraborty, Tristan Caulfield, David Pym","Causal reasoning is essential for understanding decision-making about the behaviour of complex `ecosystems' of systems that underpin modern society, with security -- including issues around correctness, safety, resilience, etc. -- typically providing critical examples. We present a theory of strategic reasoning about system modelling based on minimal structural assumptions and employing the methods of transition systems, supported by a modal logic of system states in the tradition of van Benthem, Hennessy, and Milner, and validated through equivalence theorems.

Semantically-Guided Inference for Conditional Diffusion Models:   Enhancing Covariate Consistency in Time Series Forecasting,"Rui Ding, Hanyang Meng, Zeyang Zhang, Jielong Yang","Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and compatible with any conditional diffusion framework.

Faster Distributed $Δ$-Coloring via a Reduction to MIS,"Yann Bourreau, Sebastian Brandt, Alexandre Nolin","Recent improvements on the deterministic complexities of fundamental graph problems in the LOCAL model of distributed computing have yielded state-of-the-art upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds for maximal independent set (MIS) and $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring [Ghaffari, Grunau, FOCS'24] and $\tilde{O}(\log^{19/9} n)$ rounds for the more restrictive $\Delta$-coloring problem [Ghaffari, Kuhn, FOCS'21; Ghaffari, Grunau, FOCS'24; Bourreau, Brandt, Nolin, STOC'25]. In our work, we show that $\Delta$-coloring can be solved deterministically in $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds as well, matching the currently best bound for $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring.   We achieve our result by developing a reduction from $\Delta$-coloring to MIS that guarantees that the (asymptotic) complexity of $\Delta$-coloring is at most the complexity of MIS, unless MIS can be solved in sublogarithmic time, in which case, due to the $\Omega(\log n)$-round $\Delta$-coloring lower bound from [BFHKLRSU, STOC'16], our reduction implies a tight complexity of $\Theta(\log n)$ for $\Delta$-coloring. In particular, any improvement on the complexity of the MIS problem will yield the same improvement for the complexity of $\Delta$-coloring (up to the true complexity of $\Delta$-coloring).   Our reduction yields improvements for $\Delta$-coloring in the randomized LOCAL model and when complexities are parameterized by both $n$ and $\Delta$. We obtain a randomized complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} \log n)$ rounds (improving over the state of the art of $\tilde{O}(\log^{8/3} \log n)$ rounds) on general graphs and tight complexities of $\Theta(\log n)$ and $\Theta(\log \log n)$ for the deterministic, resp.\ randomized, complexity on bounded-degree graphs.

This visual prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance.

In particular, the risk of side-channel attacks that reveal architectural details without physical access remains underexplored, despite the high value of the proprietary models they target. This work to the best of our knowledge is the first to investigate GPU power and thermal fluctuations as side-channels and further exploit them to extract information from pre-trained transformer models. The proposed analysis shows how these side channels can be exploited at user-privilege to reveal critical architectural details such as encoder/decoder layer and attention head for both language and vision transformers. We demonstrate the practical impact by evaluating multiple language and vision pre-trained transformers which are publicly available. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that the attack model achieves a high accuracy of over 89% on average for model family identification and 100% for hyperparameter classification, in both single-process as well as noisy multi-process scenarios. Moreover, by leveraging the extracted architectural information, we demonstrate highly effective black-box transfer adversarial attacks with an average success rate exceeding 93%, underscoring the security risks posed by GPU side-channel leakage in deployed transformer models.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01768v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01768v1,cs.CR

Transfer learning from related hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach. Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from 124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA, CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C, convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters.

Uncertainty-Based Methods for Automated Process Reward Data Construction   and Output Aggregation in Mathematical Reasoning,"Jiuzhou Han, Wray Buntine, Ehsan Shareghi","Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step, thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Jiuzhouh/UnPRM.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01773v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01773v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"
VAGPO: Vision-augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization for the   Routing Problems,"Shiyan Liu, Bohan Tan, Yan Jin","The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and scalability.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01774v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01774v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"

In online HD map generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios.

The AI-Augmented Research Process: A Historian's Perspective,Christian Henriot,"This paper presents a detailed case study of how artificial intelligence, especially large language models, can be integrated into historical research workflows. The workflow is divided into nine steps, covering the full research cycle from question formulation to dissemination and reproducibility, and includes two framing phases that address setup and documentation. Each research step is mapped across three operational domains: 1. LLM, referring to tasks delegated to language models; 2. Mind, referring to conceptual and interpretive contributions by the historian; and 3. Computational, referring to conventional programming-based methods like Python, R, Cytoscape, etc. The study emphasizes that LLMs are not replacements for domain expertise but can support and expand capacity of historians to process, verify, and interpret large corpora of texts. At the same time, it highlights the necessity of rigorous quality control, cross-checking outputs, and maintaining scholarly standards. Drawing from an in-depth study of three Shanghai merchants, the paper also proposes a structured workflow based on a real case study hat articulates the cognitive labor of the historian with both computational tools and generative AI. This paper makes both a methodological and epistemological contribution by showing how AI can be responsibly incorporated into historical research through transparent and reproducible workflows. It is intended as a practical guide and critical reflection for historians facing the increasingly complex landscape of AI-enhanced scholarship.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01779v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01779v1,cs.CY
LiveMCPBench: Can Agents Navigate an Ocean of MCP Tools?,"Guozhao Mo, Wenliang Zhong, Jiawei Chen, Xuanang Chen, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Le Sun","With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and 527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model (Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic, tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable and reproducible research on agent capabilities.

A comprehensive taxonomy of hallucinations in Large Language Models,Manuel Cossio,"Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation, ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes, categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical applications.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01781v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01781v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI, I.2.7"
Joint Lossless Compression and Steganography for Medical Images via   Large Language Models,"Pengcheng Zheng, Xiaorong Pu, Kecheng Chen, Jiaxin Huang, Meng Yang, Bai Feng, Yazhou Ren, Jianan Jiang","Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promis ing progress in lossless image compression. However, di rectly adopting existing paradigms for medical images suf fers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression   performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based   compressors often overlook the security of the compres sion process, which is critical in modern medical scenarios.   To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression   and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing   (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages   into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this in sight, an adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first   devised to partition the entire image into two segments, pro viding global and local modalities for subsequent dual-path   lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we inno vatively propose a segmented message steganography algo rithm within the local modality path to ensure the security of   the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatom ical priors-based low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning   strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the su periority of our proposed method in terms of compression ra tios, efficiency, and security.

RouteMark: A Fingerprint for Intellectual Property Attribution in   Routing-based Model Merging,"Xin He, Junxi Shen, Zhenheng Tang, Xiaowen Chu, Bo Li, Ivor W. Tsang, Yew-Soon Ong","Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs. To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF), characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones. Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning, pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness. Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01784v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01784v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.ET, cs.LG"
"Skip priors and add graph-based anatomical information, for point-based   Couinaud segmentation","Xiaotong Zhang, Alexander Broersen, Gonnie CM van Erp, Silvia L. Pintea, Jouke Dijkstra","The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features. This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores compared to four pioneering point-based methods.

Sonify Anything: Towards Context-Aware Sonic Interactions in AR,"Laura Schütz, Sasan Matinfar, Ulrich Eck, Daniel Roth, Nassir Navab","In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual objects interact with real objects. However, the lack of physicality of virtual objects leads to the absence of natural sonic interactions. When virtual and real objects collide, either no sound or a generic sound is played. Both lead to an incongruent multisensory experience, reducing interaction and object realism. Unlike in Virtual Reality (VR) and games, where predefined scenes and interactions allow for the playback of pre-recorded sound samples, AR requires real-time sound synthesis that dynamically adapts to novel contexts and objects to provide audiovisual congruence during interaction. To enhance real-virtual object interactions in AR, we propose a framework for context-aware sounds using methods from computer vision to recognize and segment the materials of real objects. The material's physical properties and the impact dynamics of the interaction are used to generate material-based sounds in real-time using physical modelling synthesis. In a user study with 24 participants, we compared our congruent material-based sounds to a generic sound effect, mirroring the current standard of non-context-aware sounds in AR applications. The results showed that material-based sounds led to significantly more realistic sonic interactions. Material-based sounds also enabled participants to distinguish visually similar materials with significantly greater accuracy and confidence. These findings show that context-aware, material-based sonic interactions in AR foster a stronger sense of realism and enhance our perception of real-world surroundings.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01789v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01789v1,"cs.HC, cs.CV, cs.SD, eess.AS, H.5.5; H.5.2; H.5.1; I.3.5"
CSLRConformer: A Data-Centric Conformer Approach for Continuous Arabic   Sign Language Recognition on the Isharah Datase,Fatimah Mohamed Emad Elden,"The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed, centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline, and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd place ranking on the official competition platform.

Beyond the Wavefunction: Qualia Abstraction Language Mechanics and the   Grammar of Awareness,"Mikołaj Sienicki, Krzysztof Sienicki","We propose a formal reconstruction of quantum mechanics grounded not in external mathematical abstractions, but in the structured dynamics of subjective experience. The Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL) models physical systems as evolving streams of introspective units, structured sequences of modality, shape, and functional effect, rather than as state vectors in Hilbert space. This approach reimagines core quantum concepts: superposition becomes a form of structured ambiguity; collapse is reframed as an introspective contraction; and entanglement is modeled as semantic resonance across streams of qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight theoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics reflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a formal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a vocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within the system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation. We analyze the alignment of QAL with endophysical approaches, contrast it with standard interpretations of quantum theory, and explore its implications for a post Platonist, introspectively grounded physics.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02755v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02755v1,"physics.hist-ph, cs.AI"

This integrated method can produce audio with high-fidelity spectrograms that are challenging for both human listeners and machine classifiers to differentiate from authentic recordings.

To address these limitations, we introduce a pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements, including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1% in virtual screening.

Existing accelerator-generation tools, such as AMD's FINN, do not adequately address extreme resource limitations faced by IoT endpoints operating in bare-metal environments without an operating system (OS). To overcome these constraints, we propose MARVEL-an automated, end-to-end framework that generates custom RISC-V ISA extensions tailored to specific DNN model classes, with a primary focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method profiles high-level DNN representations in Python and generates an ISA-extended RISC-V core with associated compiler tools for efficient deployment.

M3LLM: Model Context Protocol-aided Mixture of Vision Experts For   Multimodal LLMs in Networks,"Yongjie Zeng, Hongyang Du","Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on centralized architectures and often suffer from poor alignment between the input task and their fixed visual encoding modules, which limits performance on diverse and dynamic visual tasks. With the increasing deployment of resource-efficient models on edge devices in wireless networks, a new opportunity emerges to dynamically use distributed vision experts for improved MLLM inference quality. To enable this, we propose M3LLM, where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) coordinates a mixture of vision experts to achieve distributed MLLMs. Specifically, MCP is an open protocol that structures the input task context into interpretable representations, enabling wireless network-aware coordination between the central model backbone and edge-hosted vision experts. Based on the MCP representation, M3LLM formulates vision expert routing as a joint optimization problem that balances task-expert semantic compatibility and channel performance. To solve the resulting gradient conflicts, we develop a dual-stream Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with decoupled reward signals and introduce an Adaptive Stability Enhancement Module (ASEM) based on hierarchical Bayesian modeling to ensure effective routing.

Mitigating Persistent Client Dropout in Asynchronous Decentralized   Federated Learning,"Ignacy Stępka, Nicholas Gisolfi, Kacper Trębacz, Artur Dubrawski","We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid).

Learning to Perform Low-Contact Autonomous Nasotracheal Intubation by   Recurrent Action-Confidence Chunking with Transformer,"Yu Tian, Ruoyi Hao, Yiming Huang, Dihong Xie, Catherine Po Ling Chan, Jason Ying Kuen Chan, Hongliang Ren","Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is critical for establishing artificial airways in clinical anesthesia and critical care. Current manual methods face significant challenges, including cross-infection, especially during respiratory infection care, and insufficient control of endoluminal contact forces, increasing the risk of mucosal injuries. While existing studies have focused on automated endoscopic insertion, the automation of NTI remains unexplored despite its unique challenges: Nasotracheal tubes exhibit greater diameter and rigidity than standard endoscopes, substantially increasing insertion complexity and patient risks. We propose a novel autonomous NTI system with two key components to address these challenges. First, an autonomous NTI system is developed, incorporating a prosthesis embedded with force sensors, allowing for safety assessment and data filtering. Then, the Recurrent Action-Confidence Chunking with Transformer (RACCT) model is developed to handle complex tube-tissue interactions and partial visual observations. Experimental results demonstrate that the RACCT model outperforms the ACT model in all aspects and achieves a 66% reduction in average peak insertion force compared to manual operations while maintaining equivalent success rates. This validates the system's potential for reducing infection risks and improving procedural safety.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01808v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01808v1,cs.RO
Exploring Stiffness Gradient Effects in Magnetically Induced Metamorphic   Materials via Continuum Simulation and Validation,"Wentao Shi, Yang Yang, Yiming Huang, Hongliang Ren","Magnetic soft continuum robots are capable of bending with remote control in confined space environments, and they have been applied in various bioengineering contexts. As one type of ferromagnetic soft continuums, the Magnetically Induced Metamorphic Materials (MIMMs)-based continuum (MC) exhibits similar bending behaviors. Based on the characteristics of its base material, MC is flexible in modifying unit stiffness and convenient in molding fabrication. However, recent studies on magnetic continuum robots have primarily focused on one or two design parameters, limiting the development of a comprehensive magnetic continuum bending model. In this work, we constructed graded-stiffness MCs (GMCs) and developed a numerical model for GMCs' bending performance, incorporating four key parameters that determine their performance. The simulated bending results were validated with real bending experiments in four different categories: varying magnetic field, cross-section, unit stiffness, and unit length. The graded-stiffness design strategy applied to GMCs prevents sharp bending at the fixed end and results in a more circular curvature. We also trained an expansion model for GMCs' bending performance that is highly efficient and accurate compared to the simulation process. An extensive library of bending prediction for GMCs was built using the trained model.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01810v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01810v1,cs.RO
HeQ: a Large and Diverse Hebrew Reading Comprehension Benchmark,"Amir DN Cohen, Hilla Merhav, Yoav Goldberg, Reut Tsarfaty","Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies, disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.   To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ (Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM) are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant enhancement.   In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU models for Hebrew and other MRLs.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01812v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01812v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
AGENTICT$^2$S:Robust Text-to-SPARQL via Agentic Collaborative Reasoning   over Heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs for the Circular Economy,"Yang Zhao, Chengxiao Dai, Wei Zhuo, Tan Chuan Fu, Yue Xiu, Dusit Niyato, Jonathan Z. Low, Eugene Ho Hong Zhuang, Daren Zong Loong Tan","Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains such as the circular economy, where information about classifications, processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval, query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing the average prompt length by 46.4%.

On the normalization of trigonometric and hyperbolic B-splines,Hendrik Speleers,"Trigonometric and hyperbolic B-splines can be computed via recurrence relations analogous to the classical polynomial B-splines. However, in their original formulation, these two types of B-splines do not form a partition of unity and consequently do not admit the notion of control polygons with the convex hull property for design purposes. In this paper, we look into explicit expressions for their normalization and provide a recursive algorithm to compute the corresponding normalization weights. As example application, we consider the exact representation of a circle in terms of $C^{2n-1}$ trigonometric B-splines of order $m=2n+1\geq3$, with a variable number of control points. We also illustrate the approximation power of trigonometric and hyperbolic splines.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01817v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01817v1,"math.NA, cs.NA"
Runtime Consultants,"Dana Fisman, Elina Sudit","In this paper we introduce the notion of a runtime consultant. A runtime consultant is defined with respect to some value function on infinite words. Similar to a runtime monitor, it runs in parallel to an execution of the system and provides inputs at every step of the run. While a runtime monitor alerts when a violation occurs, the idea behind a consultant is to be pro-active and provide recommendations for which action to take next in order to avoid violation (or obtain a maximal value for quantitative objectives). It is assumed that a runtime-controller can take these recommendations into consideration. The runtime consultant does not assume that its recommendations are always followed. Instead, it adjusts to the actions actually taken (similar to a vehicle navigation system). We show how to compute a runtime consultant for common value functions used in verification, and that almost all have a runtime consultant that works in constant time. We also develop consultants for $\omega$-regular properties, under both their classical Boolean semantics and their recently proposed quantitative interpretation.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01821v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01821v1,"cs.FL, F.4.3"

This work achieves a significant acceleration via a novel deep learning-based framework, utilizing a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) coupled with Cubic Spline Interpolation and Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP). We demonstrate the method for binary spinodal decomposition by predicting microstructure evolution for intermediate alloy compositions from a limited set of training compositions. First, using microstructures from phase-field simulations of binary spinodal decomposition, we train the CVAE, which learns compact latent representations that encode essential morphological features. Next, we use cubic spline interpolation in the latent space to predict microstructures for any unknown composition. Finally, SLERP ensures smooth morphological evolution with time that closely resembles coarsening. The predicted microstructures exhibit high visual and statistical similarity to phase-field simulations. This framework offers a scalable and efficient surrogate model for microstructure evolution, enabling accelerated materials design and composition optimization.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01822v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01822v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.AI"
Unraveling the Connection: How Cognitive Workload Shapes Intent   Recognition in Robot-Assisted Surgery,"Mansi Sharma, Antonio Kruger","Robot-assisted surgery has revolutionized the healthcare industry by providing surgeons with greater precision, reducing invasiveness, and improving patient outcomes. However, the success of these surgeries depends heavily on the robotic system ability to accurately interpret the intentions of the surgical trainee or even surgeons. One critical factor impacting intent recognition is the cognitive workload experienced during the procedure. In our recent research project, we are building an intelligent adaptive system to monitor cognitive workload and improve learning outcomes in robot-assisted surgery. The project will focus on achieving a semantic understanding of surgeon intents and monitoring their mental state through an intelligent multi-modal assistive framework.

Exploring environment exploitation for self-reconfiguration in modular   robotics,"Philippe Martin Wyder, Haorui Li, Andrew Bae, Henry Zhao, Mark Yim","Modular robotics research has long been preoccupied with perfecting the modules themselves -- their actuation methods, connectors, controls, communication, and fabrication. This inward focus results, in part, from the complexity of the task and largely confines modular robots to sterile laboratory settings. The latest generation of truss modular robots, such as the Variable Topology Truss and the Truss Link, have begun to focus outward and reveal a key insight: the environment is not just a backdrop; it is a tool. In this work, we shift the paradigm from building better robots to building better robot environment interactions for modular truss robots. We study how modular robots can effectively exploit their surroundings to achieve faster locomotion, adaptive self-reconfiguration, and complex three-dimensional assembly from simple two-dimensional robot assemblies. By using environment features -- ledges, gaps, and slopes -- we show how the environment can extend the robots' capabilities. Nature has long mastered this principle: organisms not only adapt, but exploit their environments to their advantage. Robots must learn to do the same. This study is a step towards modular robotic systems that transcend their limitations by exploiting environmental features.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01829v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01829v1,cs.RO
Large Kernel MedNeXt for Breast Tumor Segmentation and Self-Normalizing   Network for pCR Classification in Magnetic Resonance Images,Toufiq Musah,"Accurate breast tumor segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is important for downstream tasks such as pathological complete response (pCR) assessment. In this work, we address both segmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI dataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage training strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels using the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned features to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen validation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of 0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR classification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic features extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast DCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\%, and up to 75\% in some subgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive fields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on advanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further improve performance and generalization.

However, challenges remain in modeling spectrum competition, integrating expert knowledge, and predicting opponent behavior. To address these issues, we propose UAV-FPG (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Frequency Point Game), a game-theoretic environment model that simulates the dynamic interaction between interference and anti-interference strategies of opponent and ally UAVs in communication frequency bands. The model incorporates a prior expert knowledge base to optimize frequency selection and employs large language models for path planning, simulating a ""strong adversary"". Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of integrating the expert knowledge base and the large language model, with the latter significantly improving path planning in dynamic scenarios through iterative interactions, outperforming fixed-path strategies.

MLP Memory: Language Modeling with Retriever-pretrained External Memory,"Rubin Wei, Jiaqi Cao, Jiarui Wang, Jushi Kai, Qipeng Guo, Bowen Zhou, Zhouhan Lin","While modern decoder-only LLMs achieve superior performance across various domains, hallucinations have risen to be a common problem in their generated text, hindering their application in knowledge-intensive tasks. Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution, but the non-parametric nature of the retriever hinders its deep interaction with LLM. In this work, we propose to decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained, differentiable external memory. The external memory is an MLP pretrained by imitating the behavior of a retriever on the entire pretraining dataset. Our resulting architecture, which comprises a transformer decoder and an external MLP memory pretrained on language modeling and retriever imitation respectively, demonstrates strong perplexity and performance on downstream tasks. Experiments show our architecture exhibits steeper power-law scaling with model size, achieving 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web datasets compared to decoder-only models while benefiting from added training without overfitting. We demonstrate superior performance on three hallucination benchmarks and nine memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, our approach delivers $80\times$ speedup over $k$NN-LM (500M tokens) and $1.3\times$ faster inference than decoder-only models. Unlike $k$NN-LM, which impairs reasoning, our MLP memory improves StrategyQA performance.

Neural Predictive Control to Coordinate Discrete- and Continuous-Time   Models for Time-Series Analysis with Control-Theoretical Improvements,"Haoran Li, Muhao Guo, Yang Weng, Hanghang Tong","Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis, such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation, extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and (2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics. During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions, indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01833v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01833v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
"Efficient optimization of expensive black-box simulators via marginal   means, with application to neutrino detector design","Hwanwoo Kim, Simon Mak, Ann-Kathrin Schuetz, Alan Poon","With advances in scientific computing, computer experiments are increasingly used for optimizing complex systems. However, for modern applications, e.g., the optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require hundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over a high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs $\mathbf{x}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated inputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases. Existing black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner'' (PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address this, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM) approach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\mathbf{x}^*$ that leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently inferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can select solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance. Assuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with unknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM estimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization rate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods, thus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a practical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive Gaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of BOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector optimization in nuclear physics.",2025-08-03,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01834v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01834v2,"stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.CO, stat.ME"

In this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data, we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including key motion states and their associated motion constraints.

When not to help: planning for lasting human-AI collaboration,"Mark Steyvers, Lukas Mayer","AI systems and technologies that can interact with humans in real time face a communication dilemma: when to offer assistance and how frequently. Overly frequent or contextually redundant assistance can cause users to disengage, undermining the long-term benefits of AI assistance. We introduce a cognitive modeling framework based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) that addresses this timing challenge by inferring a user's latent cognitive state related to AI engagement over time. Additionally, our framework incorporates reasoning about the long-term effects of AI assistance, explicitly aiming to avoid actions that could lead the human user to disengage or deactivate the AI. A key component of our approach is counterfactual reasoning: at each time step, the AI considers how well the user would perform independently and weighs the potential boost in performance against the risk of diminishing engagement with the AI. Through simulations, we show that this adaptive strategy significantly outperforms baseline policies in which assistance is always provided or never provided. Our results highlight the importance of balancing short-term decision accuracy with sustained user engagement, showing how communication strategies can be optimized to avoid alert fatigue while preserving the user's receptiveness to AI guidance.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01837v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01837v1,cs.HC

We refer to this novel computational paradigm as AirFC. We first study the case in which the precoder, combiner, and RIS phase shift matrices are jointly optimized to minimize the mismatch between the OAC system and the target FC layer. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all optimization variables are derived. Next, we consider training of the system parameters using two distinct learning strategies, namely centralized training and distributed training. In the centralized training approach, training is performed at either the transmitter or the receiver, whichever possesses the channel state information (CSI), and the trained parameters are provided to the other terminal. In the distributed training approach, the transmitter and receiver iteratively update their parameters through back and forth transmissions by leveraging channel reciprocity, thereby avoiding CSI acquisition and significantly reducing computational complexity. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to a multi-RIS scenario by exploiting its spatial diversity gain to enhance the system performance.

OmniEvent: Unified Event Representation Learning,"Weiqi Yan, Chenlu Lin, Youbiao Wang, Zhipeng Cai, Xiuhong Lin, Yangyang Shi, Weiquan Liu, Yu Zang","Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks and 10 datasets (Fig.1).

Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.

Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues, enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent, challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15777v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15777v1,"cs.HC, cs.CV, physics.soc-ph"
Test-Time Training for Speech Enhancement,"Avishkar Behera, Riya Ann Easow, Venkatesh Parvathala, K. Sri Rama Murty","This paper introduces a novel application of Test-Time Training (TTT) for Speech Enhancement, addressing the challenges posed by unpredictable noise conditions and domain shifts. This method combines a main speech enhancement task with a self-supervised auxiliary task in a Y-shaped architecture. The model dynamically adapts to new domains during inference time by optimizing the proposed self-supervised tasks like noise-augmented signal reconstruction or masked spectrogram prediction, bypassing the need for labeled data. We further introduce various TTT strategies offering a trade-off between adaptation and efficiency. Evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets show consistent improvements across speech quality metrics, outperforming the baseline model. This work highlights the effectiveness of TTT in speech enhancement, providing insights for future research in adaptive and robust speech processing.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01847v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01847v1,"eess.AS, cs.LG, cs.SD"
Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series through Mutual Information   Featurization,"Gian Marco Paldino, Gianluca Bontempi","Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics. This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for uncovering causal structures in complex systems.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01848v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01848v1,"cs.LG, stat.ME, stat.ML"
ChairPose: Pressure-based Chair Morphology Grounded Sitting Pose   Estimation through Simulation-Assisted Training,"Lala Shakti Swarup Ray, Vitor Fortes Rey, Bo Zhou, Paul Lukowicz, Sungho Suh","Prolonged seated activity is increasingly common in modern environments, raising concerns around musculoskeletal health, ergonomics, and the design of responsive interactive systems. Existing posture sensing methods such as vision-based or wearable approaches face limitations including occlusion, privacy concerns, user discomfort, and restricted deployment flexibility. We introduce ChairPose, the first full body, wearable free seated pose estimation system that relies solely on pressure sensing and operates independently of chair geometry. ChairPose employs a two stage generative model trained on pressure maps captured from a thin, chair agnostic sensing mattress. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly incorporates chair morphology into the inference process, enabling accurate, occlusion free, and privacy preserving pose estimation. To support generalization across diverse users and chairs, we introduce a physics driven data augmentation pipeline that simulates realistic variations in posture and seating conditions. Evaluated across eight users and four distinct chairs, ChairPose achieves a mean per joint position error of 89.4 mm when both the user and the chair are unseen, demonstrating robust generalization to novel real world generalizability. ChairPose expands the design space for posture aware interactive systems, with potential applications in ergonomics, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01850v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01850v1,"cs.HC, cs.AI"
CTBench: Cryptocurrency Time Series Generation Benchmark,"Yihao Ang, Qiang Wang, Qiang Huang, Yifan Bao, Xinyu Xi, Anthony K. H.

However, in cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work (1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsf{CTBench}, the first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain. \textsf{CTBench} curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy, rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: (1) the \emph{Predictive Utility} task measures how well synthetic data preserves temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while (2) the \emph{Statistical Arbitrage} task assesses whether reconstructed series support mean-reverting signals for trading. We benchmark eight representative models from five methodological families over four distinct market regimes, uncovering trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability. Notably, \textsf{CTBench} offers model ranking analysis and actionable guidance for selecting and deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and strategy development.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02758v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02758v1,"q-fin.ST, cs.AI, cs.CE, cs.DB, cs.LG"
Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression,"Junlong Tong, Wei Zhang, Yaohui Jin, Xiaoyu Shen","Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional entropy model.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01852v1,"cs.CV, cs.MM"
Distinguishing Target and Non-Target Fixations with EEG and Eye Tracking   in Realistic Visual Scenes,"Mansi Sharma, Camilo Andrés Martínez Martínez, Benedikt Emanuel Wirth, Antonio Krüger, Philipp Müller","Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a 36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials, which reached only 56.9% accuracy.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01853v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01853v1,"cs.CV, cs.HC"

Efficient Byzantine Consensus MechanismBased on Reputation in IoT   Blockchain,"Xu Yuan, Fang Luo, Muhammad Zeeshan Haider, Zhikui Chen, Yucheng Li","Blockchain technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and is now widely used in a variety of fields. Blockchain appears to be one of the best solutions for managing massive heterogeneous devices while achieving advanced data security and data reputation, particularly in the field of large-scale IoT (Internet of Things) networks. Despite the numerous advantages, there are still challenges while deploying IoT applications on blockchain systems due to the limited storage, power, and computing capability of IoT devices, and some of these problems are caused by the consensus algorithm, which plays a significant role in blockchain systems by ensuring overall system reliability and robustness. Nonetheless, most existing consensus algorithms are prone to poor node reliability, low transaction per second (TPS) rates, and scalability issues. Aiming at some critical problems in the existing consensus algorithms, this paper proposes the Efficient Byzantine Reputation-based Consensus (EBRC) mechanism to resolve the issues raised above. In comparison to traditional algorithms, we reinvented ways to evaluate node reliability and robustness and manage active nodes. Our experiments show that the EBRC algorithm has lower consensus delay, higher throughput, improved security, and lower verification costs.

Quantum Inspired Legal Tech Environmental Integration for Emergency   Pharmaceutical Logistics with Entropy Modulated Collapse and Multilevel   Governance,"Ruicheng Li, Jingxu Wu","Emergency pharmaceutical logistics during rapid-onset disasters must balance timeliness, legal compliance, and environmental uncertainty. We present a hybrid framework that co-designs quantum-inspired decision dynamics, embedded legal constraints, and blockchain-verified environmental feedback. Candidate routes are modeled as a superposed state whose collapse is governed by entropy modulation-delaying commitment under ambiguity and accelerating resolution when coherent signals emerge. Legal statutes act as real-time projection operators shaping feasible choices, while environmental decoherence cues adjust confidence and path viability. The core engine is situated within a multilevel governance and mechanism design architecture, establishing clear roles, accountability channels, and audit trails. Large-scale simulations in wildfire scenarios demonstrate substantial gains over conventional baselines in latency, compliance, and robustness, while preserving interpretability and fairness adaptation.

Web-CogReasoner: Towards Knowledge-Induced Cognitive Reasoning for Web   Agents,"Yuhan Guo, Cong Guo, Aiwen Sun, Hongliang He, Xinyu Yang, Yue Lu, Yingji Zhang, Xuntao Guo, Dong Zhang, Jianzhuang Liu, Jiang Duan, Yijia Xiao, Liangjian Wen, Hai-Ming Xu, Yong Dai","Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore, we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two knowledge types, representing the ""what"" of learning. Conversely, cognitive processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining the ""how"" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the ""nouns"" upon which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities.

Hedging with memory: shallow and deep learning with signatures,"Eduardo Abi Jaber, Louis-Amand Gérard","We investigate the use of path signatures in a machine learning context for hedging exotic derivatives under non-Markovian stochastic volatility models. In a deep learning setting, we use signatures as features in feedforward neural networks and show that they outperform LSTMs in most cases, with orders of magnitude less training compute. In a shallow learning setting, we compare two regression approaches: the first directly learns the hedging strategy from the expected signature of the price process; the second models the dynamics of volatility using a signature volatility model, calibrated on the expected signature of the volatility. Solving the hedging problem in the calibrated signature volatility model yields more accurate and stable results across different payoffs and volatility dynamics.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02759v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02759v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, q-fin.CP, q-fin.MF, 60L10, 91G20, 91G60"
Implicit Search Intent Recognition using EEG and Eye Tracking: Novel   Dataset and Cross-User Prediction,"Mansi Sharma, Shuang Chen, Philipp Müller, Maurice Rekrut, Antonio Krüger","For machines to effectively assist humans in challenging visual search tasks, they must differentiate whether a human is simply glancing into a scene (navigational intent) or searching for a target object (informational intent). Previous research proposed combining electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking measurements to recognize such search intents implicitly, i.e., without explicit user input. However, the applicability of these approaches to real-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work used fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark contrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found. Second, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios that require ground truth training data from the target user, which is impractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first publicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs. informational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We present the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG and eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out evaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but offering much greater flexibility",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01860v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01860v1,"cs.HC, cs.CV"
ACT-Tensor: Tensor Completion Framework for Financial Dataset Imputation,"Junyi Mo, Jiayu Li, Duo Zhang, Elynn Chen","Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining asset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies. Such panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and financial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional imputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional structure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting in the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we introduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion framework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing multi-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key innovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional heterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal smoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving slow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation accuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity scenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed data with an asset-pricing pipeline tailored for tensor-structured financial data. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only reduces pricing errors but also significantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio.

Counterfactual Probing for Hallucination Detection and Mitigation in   Large Language Models,Yijun Feng,"Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods, while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an average of 24.5%.

Structure Maintained Representation Learning Neural Network for Causal   Inference,"Yang Sun, Wenbin Lu, Yi-Hui Zhou","Recent developments in causal inference have greatly shifted the interest from estimating the average treatment effect to the individual treatment effect. In this article, we improve the predictive accuracy of representation learning and adversarial networks in estimating individual treatment effects by introducing a structure keeper which maintains the correlation between the baseline covariates and their corresponding representations in the high dimensional space. We train a discriminator at the end of representation layers to trade off representation balance and information loss. We show that the proposed discriminator minimizes an upper bound of the treatment estimation error. We can address the tradeoff between distribution balance and information loss by considering the correlations between the learned representation space and the original covariate feature space.

Separation Logic of Generic Resources via Sheafeology,"Berend van Starkenburg, Henning Basold, Chase Ford","Separation logic was conceived in order to make the verification of pointer programs scalable to large systems and it has proven extremely effective. The key idea is that programs typically access only small parts of memory, allowing for local reasoning. This idea is implemented in separation logic by extending first-order logic with separating connectives, which inspect local regions of memory. It turns that this approach not only applies to pointer programs, but also to programs involving other resource structures. Various theories have been put forward to extract and apply the ideas of separation logic more broadly. This resulted in algebraic abstractions of memory and many variants of separation logic for, e.g., concurrent programs and stochastic processes. However, none of the existing approaches formulate the combination of first-order logic with separating connectives in a theory that could immediately yield program logics for different resources. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the idea that separation logic can obtained by making first-order logic resource-aware. First-order logic can be understood in terms of categorical logic, specifically fibrations. Our contribution is to make these resource-aware by developing categorical logic internally in categories of sheaves, which is what we call sheafeology. The role of sheaves is to model views on resources, through which resources can be localised and combined, which enables the scalability promised by separation logic. We contribute constructions of an internal fibration in sheaf categories that models predicates on resources, and that admits first-order and separating connectives. Thereby, we attain a general framework of separation logic for generic resources, a claim we substantiate by instantiating our framework to various memory models and random variables.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01866v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01866v1,"cs.LO, D.3.1; F.3.1; F.3.2; F.3.3; F.4.1"

ProKG-Dial: Progressive Multi-Turn Dialogue Construction with Domain   Knowledge Graphs,"Yuanyuan Liang, Xiaoman Wang, Tingyu Xie, Lei Pan","Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships, providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues. Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity, semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance, highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01869v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01869v1,cs.AI
Multi-turn Natural Language to Graph Query Language Translation,"Yuanyuan Liang, Lei Pan, Tingyu Xie, Yunshi Lan, Weining Qian","In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph database and will be publicly released for future research.

To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps, which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall effectiveness.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01873v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01873v1,cs.CV
StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video   Understanding,"Haolin Yang, Feilong Tang, Linxiao Zhao, Xiang An, Ming Hu, Huifa Li, Xinlin Zhuang, Boqian Wang, Yifan Lu, Xiaofeng Zhang, Abdalla Swikir, Junjun He, Zongyuan Ge, Imran Razzak","Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01875v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01875v1,cs.CV
VidAnimator: User-Guided Stylized 3D Character Animation from Human   Videos,"Xinwu Ye, Jun-Hsiang Yao, Jielin Feng, Shuhong Mei, Xingyu Lan, Siming Chen","With captivating visual effects, stylized 3D character animation has gained widespread use in cinematic production, advertising, social media, and the potential development of virtual reality (VR) non-player characters (NPCs). However, animating stylized 3D characters often requires significant time and effort from animators. We propose a mixed-initiative framework and interactive system to enable stylized 3D characters to mimic motion in human videos. The framework takes a single-view human video and a stylized 3D character (the target character) as input, captures the motion of the video, and then transfers the motion to the target character. In addition, it involves two interaction modules for customizing the result. Accordingly, the system incorporates two authoring tools that empower users with intuitive modification. A questionnaire study offers tangible evidence of the framework's capability of generating natural stylized 3D character animations similar to the motion in the video.

Distributed fault-tolerant quantum memories over a 2xL array of qubit   modules,"Edwin Tham, Min Ye, Ilia Khait, John Gamble, Nicolas Delfosse","We propose an architecture for a quantum memory distributed over a $2 \times L$ array of modules equipped with a cyclic shift implemented via flying qubits. The logical information is distributed across the first row of $L$ modules and quantum error correction is executed using ancilla modules on the second row equipped with a cyclic shift. This work proves that quantum LDPC codes such as BB codes can maintain their performance in a distributed setting while using solely one simple connector: a cyclic shift. We propose two strategies to perform quantum error correction on a $2 \times L$ module array: (i) The cyclic layout which applies to any stabilizer codes, whereas previous results for qubit arrays are limited to CSS codes. (ii) The sparse cyclic layout, specific to bivariate bicycle (BB) codes. For the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, using the sparse cyclic layout we obtain a quantum memory with $12$ logical qubits distributed over $12$ modules, containing $12$ physical qubits each. We propose physical implementations of this architecture using flying qubits, that can be faithfully transported, and include qubits encoded in ions, neutral atoms, electrons or photons. We performed numerical simulations when modules are long ion chains and when modules are single-qubit arrays of ions showing that the distributed BB code achieves a logical error rate below $2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ when the physical error rate is $10^{-3}$.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01879v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01879v1,"quant-ph, cs.IT, math.IT"
Anchoring and Alignment: Data Factors in Part-to-Whole Visualization,"Connor Bailey, Michael Gleicher","We explore the effects of data and design considerations through the example case of part-to-whole data relationships. Standard part-to-whole representations like pie charts and stacked bar charts make the relationships of parts to the whole explicit. Value estimation in these charts benefits from two perceptual mechanisms: anchoring, where the value is close to a reference value with an easily recognized shape, and alignment where the beginning or end of the shape is aligned with a marker. In an online study, we explore how data and design factors such as value, position, and encoding together impact these effects in making estimations in part-to-whole charts. The results show how salient values and alignment to positions on a scale affect task performance. This demonstrates the need for informed visualization design based around how data properties and design factors affect perceptual mechanisms.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01881v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01881v1,cs.HC
A Global South Strategy for Evaluating Research Value with ChatGPT,"Robin Nunkoo, Mike Thelwall","Research evaluation is important for appointments, promotions, departmental assessments, and national science strategy monitoring. Whilst Global North universities often have sufficient senior researchers for effective peer review and enough trust in citation data to use it for supporting indicators, the same is less likely to be true in the Global South. Moreover, Global South research priorities may not align well with citation-based indicators. This article introduces a ChatGPT-based strategy designed to address both limitations, applying it to Mauritius. The strategy involves giving ChatGPT instructions about how to evaluate the quality of research from the perspective of a given Global South nation and then using it to score articles based on these criteria. Results from Mauritius show that ChatGPT's scores for 1,566 journal articles published between 2015 and 2021 have an almost zero correlation with both ChatGPT research quality scores and citation rates. A word association thematic analysis of articles with relatively high scores for value to Mauritius identified a range of plausible themes, including education, policy relevance, and industrial production. Higher scoring articles also tended to mention the country or an important commercial sector in the abstract. Whilst the evidence suggests that assessing the direct value to a country of journal articles using ChatGPT gives plausible results, this approach should be used cautiously because it has unknown accuracy and ignores the wider value of research contributions.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01882v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01882v1,cs.DL
Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization with Preemptive Penalty,"Ning Yang, Pengyu Wang, Guoqing Liu, Haifeng Zhang, Pin Lv, Jun Wang","Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research and practical applications.",2025-08-03,2025-08-06,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01883v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01883v2,cs.LG

Rutherford, Tracy Nolan, Linmin Pei, Ulrike Wagner, Qinyan Pan, Phillip Farmer, Kirk Smith, Benjamin Kopchick, Laura Opsahl-Ong, Granger Sutton, David Clunie, Keyvan Farahani, Fred Prior","Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers, preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing), 605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams. Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA Privacy Rule ""Safe Harbor"" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and TCIA best practices.

How Does Controllability Emerge In Language Models During Pretraining?,"Jianshu She, Xinyue Li, Eric Xing, Zhengzhong Liu, Qirong Ho","Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation. However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e., the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states), emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct stages of training.   To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the ""Intervention Detector"" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our findings on steerability dynamics.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01892v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01892v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
BVQC: A Backdoor-style Watermarking Scheme for Variational Quantum   Circuits,"Cheng Chu, Lei Jiang, Fan Chen","Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a powerful quantum computing paradigm, demonstrating a scaling advantage for problems intractable for classical computation. As VQCs require substantial resources and specialized expertise for their design, they represent significant intellectual properties (IPs). However, existing quantum circuit watermarking techniques suffer from two primary drawbacks: (1) watermarks can be removed during re-compilation of the circuits, and (2) these methods significantly increase task loss due to the extensive length of the inserted watermarks across multiple compilation stages. To address these challenges, we propose BVQC, a backdoor-based watermarking technique for VQCs that preserves the original loss in typical execution settings, while deliberately increasing the loss to a predefined level during watermark extraction. Additionally, BVQC employs a grouping algorithm to minimize the watermark task's interference with the base task, ensuring optimal accuracy for the base task. BVQC retains the original compilation workflow, ensuring robustness against re-compilation. Our evaluations show that BVQC greatly reduces Probabilistic Proof of Authorship (PPA) changes by 9.89e-3 and ground truth distance (GTD) by 0.089 compared to prior watermarking technologies.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01893v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01893v1,"quant-ph, cs.ET"
IMUCoCo: Enabling Flexible On-Body IMU Placement for Human Pose   Estimation and Activity Recognition,"Haozhe Zhou, Riku Arakawa, Yuvraj Agarwal, Mayank Goel","IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates (IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the context and suggests placement depending on the use case.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01894v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01894v1,"cs.HC, cs.LG"

However, existing methods primarily rely on Euclidean distances, failing to adequately capture the intrinsic hierarchical structures associated with attack categories and domain factors. To address these issues, we design a novel framework Poin-HierNet to construct domain-invariant hierarchical representations in the Poincar\'e sphere. Poin-HierNet includes three key components: 1) Poincar\'e Prototype Learning (PPL) with several data prototypes aligning sample features and capturing multilevel hierarchies beyond human labels; 2) Hierarchical Structure Learning (HSL) leverages top prototypes to establish a tree-like hierarchical structure from data prototypes; and 3) Poincar\'e Feature Whitening (PFW) enhances domain invariance by applying feature whitening to suppress domain-sensitive features.

Revenue Optimization in Wireless Video Caching Networks: A   Privacy-Preserving Two-Stage Solution,"Yijing Zhang, Md-Ferdous Pervej, Andreas F. Molisch","Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance quality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless communication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be designed to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system revenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested videos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache replacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the replacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache placement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution for revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a Transformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict multi-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely accurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content popularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand distribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results to find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This latter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we then transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to that of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching methods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper system performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based optimization approaches.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01898v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01898v1,"cs.NI, cs.SY, eess.SY"

It is a ROS2-centric framework that integrates state-of-the-art acoustic models combining a semi-empirical reference spectrum for near-field modeling with 3D ray tracing for propagation losses for far-field modeling, offering real-time computation of the ship noise signature, alongside a data-driven Southern resident killer whale distribution model. The proposed DSS performs a two-stage optimization pipeline: Batch Informed Trees for collision-free ship routing and a genetic algorithm for adaptive ship speed profiling under voyage constraints that minimizes cumulative URN exposure to marine mammals. The effectiveness of MUTE-DSS is demonstrated through case studies of ships operating between the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, comparing optimized voyages against baseline trajectories derived from automatic identification system data. Results show substantial reductions in noise exposure level, up to 7.14 dB, corresponding to approximately an 80.68% reduction in a simplified scenario, and an average 4.90 dB reduction, corresponding to approximately a 67.6% reduction in a more realistic dynamic setting.

Revisiting Replay and Gradient Alignment for Continual Pre-Training of   Large Language Models,"Istabrak Abbes, Gopeshh Subbaraj, Matthew Riemer, Nizar Islah, Benjamin Therien, Tsuguchika Tabaru, Hiroaki Kingetsu, Sarath Chandar, Irina Rish","Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100 billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of replaying old examples.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01908v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01908v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL"

A Decentralized Framework for Ethical Authorship Validation in Academic   Publishing: Leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity and Blockchain Technology,"Kamal Al-Sabahi, Yousuf Khamis Al Mabsali","Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications, increasing transparency.

EgoTrigger: Toward Audio-Driven Image Capture for Human Memory   Enhancement in All-Day Energy-Efficient Smart Glasses,"Akshay Paruchuri, Sinan Hersek, Lavisha Aggarwal, Qiao Yang, Xin Liu, Achin Kulshrestha, Andrea Colaco, Henry Fuchs, Ishan Chatterjee","All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach, EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components (e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use -- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01915v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01915v1,"cs.CV, cs.ET, cs.HC, cs.LG, cs.SD, eess.AS"
Decomposing Representation Space into Interpretable Subspaces with   Unsupervised Learning,"Xinting Huang, Michael Hahn","Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way? Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to ``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing. Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding model internals and building circuits.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01916v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01916v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL"
L3M+P: Lifelong Planning with Large Language Models,"Krish Agarwal, Yuqian Jiang, Jiaheng Hu, Bo Liu, Peter Stone","By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs), recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01917v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01917v1,"cs.RO, cs.AI"
Quantum-RAG and PunGPT2: Advancing Low-Resource Language Generation and   Retrieval for the Punjabi Language,"Jaskaranjeet Singh, Rakesh Thakur","Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2, the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches, PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall, we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance with significantly reduced compute needs.   As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in perplexity, factuality, and fluency.

"InspectVLM: Unified in Theory, Unreliable in Practice","Conor Wallace, Isaac Corley, Jonathan Lwowski","Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection, and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial inspections.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01921v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01921v1,cs.CV
Beyond Simulation: Benchmarking World Models for Planning and Causality   in Autonomous Driving,"Hunter Schofield, Mohammed Elmahgiubi, Kasra Rezaee, Jinjun Shan","World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world models under these new metrics.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01922v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01922v1,cs.RO
From Binary to Continuous: Stochastic Re-Weighting for Robust Graph   Explanation,"Zhuomin Chen, Jingchao Ni, Hojat Allah Salehi, Xu Zheng, Dongsheng Luo","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be flexibly integrated with different architectures.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01925v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01925v1,cs.LG

This study introduces a validated survey instrument designed to assess students' perceptions of GenAI, including its acceptability for academic tasks, perceived influence on learning and careers, and broader societal concerns. We administered the survey to 297 undergraduates at a U.S. university. The instrument includes six thematic domains: institutional understanding, fairness and trust, academic and career influence, societal concerns, and GenAI use in writing and coursework. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four attitudinal dimensions: societal concern, policy clarity, fairness and trust, and career impact. Subgroup analyses identified statistically significant differences across student backgrounds. Male students and those speaking a language other than English at home rated GenAI use in writing tasks as more acceptable. First-year students expressed greater societal concern than upper-year peers.

Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization. We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users.

Marlin: Efficient Coordination for Autoscaling Cloud DBMS (Extended   Version),"Wenjie Hu, Guanzhou Hu, Mahesh Balakrishnan, Xiangyao Yu","Modern cloud databases are shifting from converged architectures to storage disaggregation, enabling independent scaling and billing of compute and storage. However, cloud databases still rely on external, converged coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper) for their control planes. These services are effectively lightweight databases optimized for low-volume metadata. As the control plane scales in the cloud, this approach faces similar limitations as converged databases did before storage disaggregation: scalability bottlenecks, low cost efficiency, and increased operational burden.   We propose to disaggregate the cluster coordination to achieve the same benefits that storage disaggregation brought to modern cloud DBMSs. We present Marlin, a cloud-native coordination mechanism that fully embraces storage disaggregation. Marlin eliminates the need for external coordination services by consolidating coordination functionality into the existing cloud-native database it manages. To achieve failover without an external coordination service, Marlin allows cross-node modifications on coordination states. To ensure data consistency, Marlin employs transactions to manage both coordination and application states and introduces MarlinCommit, an optimized commit protocol that ensures strong transactional guarantees even under cross-node modifications. Our evaluations demonstrate that Marlin improves cost efficiency by up to 4.4x and reduces reconfiguration duration by up to 4.9x compared to converged coordination solutions.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01931v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01931v1,cs.DB
Proactive Disentangled Modeling of Trigger-Object Pairings for Backdoor   Defense,"Kyle Stein, Andrew A. Mahyari, Guillermo Francia III, Eman El-Sheikh","Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training pipelines.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01932v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01932v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"

GlaBoost extracts high-level visual representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model. Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation accuracy of 98.71%.

Edge open packing: further characterizations,"Arti Pandey, Kamal Santra","Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively.

A subset $D\subseteq E(G)$ is called an \emph{edge open packing set} in $G$ if no two edges in $D$ share a common edge in $G$, and the largest size of such a set in $G$ is known as \emph{edge open packing number}, represented by $\rho_{e}^o(G)$.

ROVER: Recursive Reasoning Over Videos with Vision-Language Models for   Embodied Tasks,"Philip Schroeder, Ondrej Biza, Thomas Weng, Hongyin Luo, James Glass","Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach, on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over baselines.

Inferring Reward Machines and Transition Machines from Partially   Observable Markov Decision Processes,"Yuly Wu, Jiamou Liu, Libo Zhang","Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations. Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.

The task involves selecting substation breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network (LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds.

Non-self-adjoint sixth-order eigenvalue problems arising from clamped   elastic thin films on closed domains,"N C Papanicolaou, I C Christov","Sixth-order boundary value problems (BVPs) arise in thin-film flows with a surface that has elastic bending resistance. We consider the case in which the elastic interface is clamped at the lateral walls of a closed trough and thus encloses a finite amount of fluid. For a slender film undergoing infinitesimal deformations, the displacement of the elastic surface from its initial equilibrium position obeys a sixth-order (in space) initial boundary value problem (IBVP). To solve this IBVP, we construct a set of odd and even eigenfunctions that intrinsically satisfy the boundary conditions (BCs) of the original IBVP. These eigenfunctions are the solutions of a non-self-adjoint sixth-order eigenvalue problem (EVP). To use the eigenfunctions for series expansions, we also construct and solve the adjoint EVP, leading to another set of even and odd eigenfunctions, which are orthogonal to the original set (biorthogonal). The eigenvalues of the adjoint EVP are the same as those of the original EVP, and we find accurate asymptotic formulas for them. Next, employing the biorthogonal sets of eigenfunctions, a Petrov--Galerkin spectral method for sixth-order problems is proposed, which can also handle lower-order terms in the IBVP. The proposed method is tested on two model sixth-order BVPs, which admit exact solutions. We explicitly derive all the necessary formulas for expanding the quantities that appear in the model problems into the set(s) of eigenfunctions. For both model problems, we find that the approximate Petrov--Galerkin spectral solution is in excellent agreement with the exact solution. The convergence rate of the spectral series is rapid, exceeding the expected sixth-order algebraic rate.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01952v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01952v1,"math.NA, cs.NA"
Agent-Based Feature Generation from Clinical Notes for Outcome   Prediction,"Jiayi Wang, Jacqueline Jil Vallon, Neil Panjwani, Xi Ling, Sushmita Vij, Sandy Srinivas, John Leppert, Mark K. Buyyounouski, Mohsen Bayati","Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance. Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in 147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for clinical deployment.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01956v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01956v1,"cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.MA"
Stochastic Encodings for Active Feature Acquisition,"Alexander Norcliffe, Changhee Lee, Fergus Imrie, Mihaela van der Schaar, Pietro Lio","Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.",2025-08-03,2025-08-06,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01957v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01957v3,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
SitEmb-v1.5: Improved Context-Aware Dense Retrieval for Semantic   Association and Long Story Comprehension,"Junjie Wu, Jiangnan Li, Yuqing Li, Lemao Liu, Liyan Xu, Jiwei Li, Dit-Yan Yeung, Jie Zhou, Mo Yu","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document, contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human bandwidth.   We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context. We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across different languages and several downstream applications.",2025-08-03,2025-08-03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01959v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01959v1,cs.CL

Schuller","Non-Verbal Vocalisations (NVVs) are short `non-word' utterances without proper linguistic (semantic) meaning but conveying connotations -- be this emotions/affects or other paralinguistic information. We start this contribution with a historic sketch: how they were addressed in psychology and linguistics in the last two centuries, how they were neglected later on, and how they came to the fore with the advent of emotion research. We then give an overview of types of NVVs (formal aspects) and functions of NVVs, exemplified with the typical NVV \textit{ah}. Interesting as they are, NVVs come, however, with a bunch of challenges that should be accounted for: Privacy and general ethical considerations prevent them of being recorded in real-life (private) scenarios to a sufficient extent. Isolated, prompted (acted) exemplars do not necessarily model NVVs in context; yet, this is the preferred strategy so far when modelling NVVs, especially in AI. To overcome these problems, we argue in favour of corpus-based approaches.

"Kronecker-LoRA: hybrid Kronecker-LoRA adapters for scalable, sustainable   fine-tuning",Yixin Shen,"Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce \textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A \otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an 840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a 5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a 3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy, Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression, quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis, Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution for multi-task adaptation of large language models.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01961v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01961v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"

In this work, we present a systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders, employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance, especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8 achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for label-efficient object detection.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01966v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01966v1,cs.CV
Accelerating LLM Reasoning via Early Rejection with Partial Reward   Modeling,"Seyyed Saeid Cheshmi, Azal Ahmad Khan, Xinran Wang, Zirui Liu, Ali Anwar","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$ reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01969v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01969v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Improving Hospital Risk Prediction with Knowledge-Augmented Multimodal   EHR Modeling,"Rituparna Datta, Jiaming Cui, Zihan Guan, Vishal G. Reddy, Joshua C. Eby, Gregory Madden, Rupesh Silwal, Anil Vullikanti","Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial, task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$, respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including established risk scoring systems.

Revitalizing Canonical Pre-Alignment for Irregular Multivariate Time   Series Forecasting,"Ziyu Zhou, Yiming Huang, Yanyun Wang, Yuankai Wu, James Kwok, Yuxuan Liang","Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations. Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1) Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain. Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01971v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01971v1,cs.LG
Flow Sensitivity without Control Flow Graph: An Efficient Andersen-Style   Flow-Sensitive Pointer Analysis,"Jiahao Zhang, Xiao Cheng, Yuxiang Lei","Flow-sensitive pointer analysis constitutes an essential component of precise program analysis for accurately modeling pointer behaviors by incorporating control flows. Flow-sensitive pointer analysis is extensively used in alias analysis, taint analysis, program understanding, compiler optimization, etc. Existing flow-sensitive pointer analysis approaches, which are conducted based on control flow graphs, have significantly advanced the precision of pointer analysis via sophisticated techniques to leverage control flow information. However, they inevitably suffer from computational inefficiencies when resolving points-to information due to the inherent complex structures of control flow graphs. We present CG-FSPTA, a Flow-Sensitive Constraint Graph (FSConsG) based flow-sensitive pointer analysis to overcome the inefficiency of control-flow-graph-based analysis. CG-FSPTA uses a flow-sensitive variant to leverage the structural advantages of set-constraint graphs (which are commonly used in flow-insensitive pointer analysis) while keeping the flow sensitivity of variable definitions and uses, allowing the incorporation of sophisticated graph optimization and dynamic solving techniques. In this way, CG-FSPTA achieves significant efficiency improvements while keeping the precision of flow-sensitive analysis. Experimental evaluations on benchmark programs demonstrate that CG-FSPTA, significantly reduces both memory usage and execution time while maintaining precision. In particular, by solving in the FSConsG, CG-FSPTA achieves an average memory reduction of 33.05\% and accelerates flow-sensitive pointer analysis by 7.27x compared to the state-of-art method. These experimental results underscore the efficacy of CG-FSPTA as a scalable solution to analyze large-scale software systems, establishing a robust foundation for future advancements in efficient program analysis frameworks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01974v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01974v1,"cs.SE, cs.PL"

Physiological Signal-Driven QoE Optimization for Wireless Virtual   Reality Transmission,"Chang Wu, Yuang Chen, Yiyuan Chen, Fengqian Guo, Xiaowei Qin, Hancheng Lu","Abrupt resolution changes in virtual reality (VR) streaming can significantly impair the quality-of-experience (QoE) of users, particularly during transitions from high to low resolutions. Existing QoE models and transmission schemes inadequately address the perceptual impact of these shifts. To bridge this gap, this article proposes, for the first time, an innovative physiological signal-driven QoE modeling and optimization framework that fully leverages users' electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and skin activity signals. This framework precisely captures the temporal dynamics of physiological responses and resolution changes in VR streaming, enabling accurate quantification of resolution upgrades' benefits and downgrades' impacts. Integrated the proposed QoE framework into the radio access network (RAN) via a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, adaptive transmission strategies have been implemented to allocate radio resources dynamically, which mitigates short-term channel fluctuations and adjusts frame resolution in response to channel variations caused by user mobility. By prioritizing long-term resolution while minimizing abrupt transitions, the proposed solution achieves an 88.7\% improvement in resolution and an 81.0\% reduction in handover over the baseline.

Controllable and Stealthy Shilling Attacks via Dispersive Latent   Diffusion,"Shutong Qiao, Wei Yuan, Junliang Yu, Tong Chen, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, Hongzhi Yin","Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms, but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users. Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that, compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01987v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01987v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.IR"
Prefill-Decode Aggregation or Disaggregation? Unifying Both for   Goodput-Optimized LLM Serving,"Chao Wang, Pengfei Zuo, Zhangyu Chen, Yunkai Liang, Zhou Yu, Ming-Chang Yang","An ongoing debate considers whether prefill-decode (PD) aggregation or disaggregation is superior for serving large language models (LLMs). This has driven optimizations for both approaches, each showing distinct advantages. This paper compares PD aggregation and disaggregation, showing that each excels under different service-level objectives (SLOs): aggregation is optimal for tight time-to-first-token (TTFT) and relaxed time-per-output-token (TPOT), while disaggregation excels for strict TPOT and relaxed TTFT. However, under balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs, neither approach delivers optimal goodput.   This paper proposes TaiChi, an LLM serving system that unifies PD disaggregation and aggregation for optimal goodput under any combination of TTFT and TPOT SLOs. TaiChi uses a unified disaggregation-aggregation architecture with differentiated-capability GPU instances: prefill-heavy (fast prefill, high-interference decode) and decode-heavy (low-interference decode, slow prefill). Three configurable sliders control the ratio between these instances and their chunk sizes. TaiChi adapts to various SLO regimes by adjusting sliders. When TTFT constraints are tight, TaiChi resembles a PD aggregation configuration; when TPOT dominates, it adapts toward PD disaggregation. Crucially, under balanced SLOs, TaiChi enables a hybrid mode for superior goodput. The key innovation behind this hybrid mode is latency shifting: selectively reallocating GPU resources from requests that meet SLOs to those at risk of violation, maximizing the number of SLO-satisfied requests. This fine-grained latency shifting is orchestrated by two scheduling mechanisms: flowing decode scheduling to control TPOTs and length-aware prefill scheduling to manage TTFTs, which jointly optimize request assignment. Our experiments show TaiChi improves goodput by up to 77% over state-of-the-art systems under balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01989v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01989v1,cs.DC

Toward Efficient Spiking Transformers: Synapse Pruning Meets Synergistic   Learning-Based Compensation,"Hongze Sun, Wuque Cai, Duo Chen, Shifeng Mao, Jiayi He, Zhenxing Wang, Dezhong Yao, Daqing Guo","As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs, thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models. Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured $\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF) neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and high-performing ST-based models.",2025-08-04,2025-09-01,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01992v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01992v2,"cs.LG, q-bio.NC"
Deeply Dual Supervised learning for melanoma recognition,"Rujosh Polma, Krishnan Menon Iyer","As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01994v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01994v1,cs.CV
GPU in the Blind Spot: Overlooked Security Risks in Transportation,"Sefatun-Noor Puspa, Mashrur Chowdhury","Graphics processing units (GPUs) are becoming an essential part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) for enabling video-based and artificial intelligence (AI) based applications. GPUs provide high-throughput and energy-efficient computing for tasks like sensor fusion and roadside video analytics. However, these GPUs are one of the most unmonitored components in terms of security. This makes them vulnerable to cyber and hardware attacks, including unauthorized crypto mining. This paper highlights GPU security as a critical blind spot in transportation cybersecurity. To support this concern, it also presents a case study showing the impact of stealthy unauthorized crypto miners on critical AI workloads, along with a detection strategy. We used a YOLOv8-based video processing pipeline running on an RTX 2060 GPU for the case study. A multi-streaming application was executed while a T-Rex crypto miner ran in the background. We monitored how the miner degraded GPU performance by reducing the frame rate and increasing power consumption, which could be a serious concern for GPUs operating in autonomous vehicles or battery-powered edge devices. We observed measurable impacts using GPU telemetry (nvidia-smi) and Nsight Compute profiling, where frame rate dropped by 50 percent, and power usage increased by up to 90%. To detect, we trained lightweight classifiers using extracted telemetry features. All models achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This paper raises urgent awareness about GPU observability gaps in ITS and offers a replicable framework for detecting GPU misuse through on-device telemetry.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01995v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01995v1,"cs.CR, cs.AR"
DySTop,"Yizhou Shi, Qianpiao Ma, Yan Xu, Junlong Zhou, Ming Hu, Yunming Liao, Hongli Xu","Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a potential distributed learning paradigm that enables model training on edge devices (i.e., workers) while preserving data privacy. However, its reliance on a centralized server leads to limited scalability. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) eliminates the dependency on a centralized server by enabling peer-to-peer model exchange. Existing DFL mechanisms mainly employ synchronous communication, which may result in training inefficiencies under heterogeneous and dynamic edge environments. Although a few recent asynchronous DFL (ADFL) mechanisms have been proposed to address these issues, they typically yield stale model aggregation and frequent model transmission, leading to degraded training performance on non-IID data and high communication overhead. To overcome these issues, we present DySTop, an innovative mechanism that jointly optimizes dynamic staleness control and topology construction in ADFL. In each round, multiple workers are activated, and a subset of their neighbors is selected to transmit models for aggregation, followed by local training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for DySTop, theoretically revealing the quantitative relationships between the convergence bound and key factors such as maximum staleness, activating frequency, and data distribution among workers. From the insights of the analysis, we propose a worker activation algorithm (WAA) for staleness control and a phase-aware topology construction algorithm (PTCA) to reduce communication overhead and handle data non-IID. Extensive evaluations through both large-scale simulations and real-world testbed experiments demonstrate that our DySTop reduces completion time by 51.8% and the communication resource consumption by 57.1% compared to state-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same model accuracy.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01996v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01996v1,cs.DC

Prompting Large Language Models to Detect Dementia Family Caregivers,"Md Badsha Biswas, Özlem Uzuner","Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task 3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem, differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results.

Localizing Audio-Visual Deepfakes via Hierarchical Boundary Modeling,"Xuanjun Chen, Shih-Peng Cheng, Jiawei Du, Lin Zhang, Xiaoxiao Miao, Chung-Che Wang, Haibin Wu, Hung-yi Lee, Jyh-Shing Roger Jang","Audio-visual temporal deepfake localization under the content-driven partial manipulation remains a highly challenging task. In this scenario, the deepfake regions are usually only spanning a few frames, with the majority of the rest remaining identical to the original. To tackle this, we propose a Hierarchical Boundary Modeling Network (HBMNet), which includes three modules: an Audio-Visual Feature Encoder that extracts discriminative frame-level representations, a Coarse Proposal Generator that predicts candidate boundary regions, and a Fine-grained Probabilities Generator that refines these proposals using bidirectional boundary-content probabilities. From the modality perspective, we enhance audio-visual learning through dedicated encoding and fusion, reinforced by frame-level supervision to boost discriminability. From the temporal perspective, HBMNet integrates multi-scale cues and bidirectional boundary-content relationships. Experiments show that encoding and fusion primarily improve precision, while frame-level supervision boosts recall. Each module (audio-visual fusion, temporal scales, bi-directionality) contributes complementary benefits, collectively enhancing localization performance.

Convolutions are Competitive with Transformers for Encrypted Traffic   Classification with Pre-training,"Chungang Lin, Weiyao Zhang, Tianyu Zuo, Chao Zha, Yilong Jiang, Ruiqi Meng, Haitong Luo, Xuying Meng, Yujun Zhang","Encrypted traffic classification is vital for modern network management and security. To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity; (2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02001v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02001v1,"cs.NI, cs.LG"
Generative Large-Scale Pre-trained Models for Automated Ad Bidding   Optimization,"Yu Lei, Jiayang Zhao, Yilei Zhao, Zhaoqi Zhang, Linyou Cai, Qianlong Xie, Xingxing Wang","Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern advertisers.

Fast and Memory-efficient Non-line-of-sight Imaging with Quasi-Fresnel   Transform,"Yijun Wei, Jianyu Wang, Leping Xiao, Zuoqiang Shi, Xing Fu, Lingyun Qiu","Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions, overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption, limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its applicability across a wider range of platforms.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02003v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02003v1,cs.CV
Devil is in the Detail: Towards Injecting Fine Details of Image Prompt   in Image Generation via Conflict-free Guidance and Stratified Attention,"Kyungmin Jo, Jooyeol Yun, Jaegul Choo","While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt. This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer, generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance. Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully reflecting the image prompt.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02004v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02004v1,cs.CV
Revelator: Rapid Data Fetching via OS-Driven Hash-based Speculative   Address Translation,"Konstantinos Kanellopoulos, Konstantinos Sgouras, Andreas Kosmas Kakolyris, Vlad-Petru Nitu, Berkin Kerim Konar, Rahul Bera, Onur Mutlu","Address translation is a major performance bottleneck in modern computing systems. Speculative address translation can hide this latency by predicting the physical address (PA) of requested data early in the pipeline. However, predicting the PA from the virtual address (VA) is difficult due to the unpredictability of VA-to-PA mappings in conventional OSes. Prior works try to overcome this but face two key issues: (i) reliance on large pages or VA-to-PA contiguity, which is not guaranteed, and (ii) costly hardware changes to store speculation metadata with limited effectiveness.   We introduce Revelator, a hardware-OS cooperative scheme enabling highly accurate speculative address translation with minimal modifications. Revelator employs a tiered hash-based allocation strategy in the OS to create predictable VA-to-PA mappings, falling back to conventional allocation when needed. On a TLB miss, a lightweight speculation engine, guided by this policy, generates candidate PAs for both program data and last-level page table entries (PTEs). Thus, Revelator (i) speculatively fetches requested data before translation resolves, reducing access latency, and (ii) fetches the fourth-level PTE before the third-level PTE is accessed, accelerating page table walks.   We prototype Revelator's OS support in Linux and evaluate it in simulation across 11 diverse, data-intensive benchmarks in native and virtualized environments. Revelator achieves average speedups of 27% (20%) in native (virtualized) settings, surpasses a state-of-the-art speculative mechanism by 5%, and reduces energy use by 9% compared to baseline.

By distinguishing between benign and malicious applications, we uncover developers' evolving strategies, with malicious apps increasingly requesting fewer permissions to evade detection, while benign apps request more to enhance functionality. In addition to examining permission trends across years and app features such as advertisements, in-app purchases, content ratings, and app sizes, we leverage association rule mining using the FP-Growth algorithm. This allows us to uncover frequent permission combinations across the entire dataset, specific years, and 16 app genres. The analysis reveals significant differences in permission usage patterns, providing a deeper understanding of co-occurring permissions and their implications for user privacy and app functionality.

A Group Consensus-Driven Auction Algorithm for Cooperative Task   Allocation Among Heterogeneous Multi-Agents,"Gang Wang, Hongfang Han, Xiaowei Liu, Hanfeng Jiang, Ming Zhang","In scenarios like automated warehouses, assigning tasks to robots presents a heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation problem. However, existing task allocation study ignores the integration of multi-task and multi-attribute agent task allocation with heterogeneous task allocation. In addition, current algorithms are limited by scenario constraints and can incur significant errors in specific contexts. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation algorithm with a time window, called group consensus-based heterogeneous auction (GCBHA). Firstly, this method decomposes tasks that exceed the capability of a single Agent into subtasks that can be completed by multiple independent agents. And then groups similar or adjacent tasks through a heuristic clustering method to reduce the time required to reach a consensus. Subsequently, the task groups are allocated to agents that meet the conditions through an auction process. Furthermore, the method evaluates the task path cost distance based on the scenario, which can calculate the task cost more accurately.

The acoustic-feature version investigates whether variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance.

Evaluating Position Bias in Large Language Model Recommendations,"Ethan Bito, Yongli Ren, Estrid He","Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly explored as general-purpose tools for recommendation tasks, enabling zero-shot and instruction-following capabilities without the need for task-specific training. While the research community is enthusiastically embracing LLMs, there are important caveats to directly adapting them for recommendation tasks. In this paper, we show that LLM-based recommendation models suffer from position bias, where the order of candidate items in a prompt can disproportionately influence the recommendations produced by LLMs. First, we analyse the position bias of LLM-based recommendations on real-world datasets, where results uncover systemic biases of LLMs with high sensitivity to input orders. Furthermore, we introduce a new prompting strategy to mitigate the position bias of LLM recommendation models called Ranking via Iterative SElection (RISE). We compare our proposed method against various baselines on key benchmark datasets. Experiment results show that our method reduces sensitivity to input ordering and improves stability without requiring model fine-tuning or post-processing.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02020v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02020v1,cs.IR
Design and Control of an Actively Morphing Quadrotor with Vertically   Foldable Arms,"Tingyu Yeh, Mengxin Xu, Lijun Han","In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor design capable of folding its arms vertically to grasp objects and navigate through narrow spaces. The transformation is controlled actively by a central servomotor, gears, and racks. The arms connect the motor bases to the central frame, forming a parallelogram structure that ensures the propellers maintain a constant orientation during morphing. In its stretched state, the quadrotor resembles a conventional design, and when contracted, it functions as a gripper with grasping components emerging from the motor bases. To mitigate disturbances during transforming and grasping payloads, we employ an adaptive sliding mode controller with a disturbance observer. After fully folded, the quadrotor frame shrinks to 67% of its original size. The control performance and versatility of the morphing quadrotor are validated through real-world experiments.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02022v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02022v1,cs.RO
PCREQ: Automated Inference of Compatible Requirements for Python   Third-party Library Upgrades,"Huashan Lei, Guanping Xiao, Yepang Liu, Zheng Zheng","Python third-party libraries (TPLs) are essential in modern software development, but upgrades often cause compatibility issues, leading to system failures. These issues fall into two categories: version compatibility issues (VCIs) and code compatibility issues (CCIs). Existing tools mainly detect dependency conflicts but overlook code-level incompatibilities, with no solution fully automating the inference of compatible versions for both VCIs and CCIs. To fill this gap, we propose PCREQ, the first approach to automatically infer compatible requirements by combining version and code compatibility analysis. PCREQ integrates six modules: knowledge acquisition, version compatibility assessment, invoked APIs and modules extraction, code compatibility assessment, version change, and missing TPL completion. PCREQ collects candidate versions, checks for conflicts, identifies API usage, evaluates code compatibility, and iteratively adjusts versions to generate a compatible requirements.txt with a detailed repair report. To evaluate PCREQ, we construct REQBench, a large-scale benchmark with 2,095 upgrade test cases (including 406 unsolvable by pip). Results show PCREQ achieves a 94.03% inference success rate, outperforming PyEGo (37.02%), ReadPyE (37.16%), and LLM-based approaches (GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3/R1) by 18-20%. PCREQ processes each case from REQBench in 60.79s on average, demonstrating practical efficiency. PCREQ significantly reduces manual effort in troubleshooting upgrades, advancing Python dependency maintenance automation.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02023v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02023v1,cs.SE
An Evolving Scenario Generation Method based on Dual-modal Driver Model   Trained by Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Xinzheng Wu, Junyi Chen, Shaolingfeng Ye, Wei Jiang, Yong Shen","In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation method.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02027v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02027v1,cs.LG
Bench2ADVLM: A Closed-Loop Benchmark for Vision-language Models in   Autonomous Driving,"Tianyuan Zhang, Ting Jin, Lu Wang, Jiangfan Liu, Siyuan Liang, Mingchuan Zhang, Aishan Liu, Xianglong Liu","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience, and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design, heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution. Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop conditions.",2025-08-04,2025-08-20,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02028v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02028v2,cs.CV
A Confidence-Diversity Framework for Calibrating AI Judgement in   Accessible Qualitative Coding Tasks,"Zhilong Zhao, Yindi Liu","LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing reliability remains challenging where human experts seldom agree. We investigate confidence-diversity calibration as a quality assessment framework for accessible coding tasks where LLMs already demonstrate strong performance but exhibit overconfidence. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across ten categories, we find that mean self-confidence tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model diversity quantified as normalised Shannon entropy produces a dual signal explaining agreement almost completely (R-squared=0.979), though this high predictive power likely reflects task simplicity for current LLMs. The framework enables a three-tier workflow auto-accepting 35 percent of segments with less than 5 percent error, cutting manual effort by 65 percent. Cross-domain validation confirms transferability (kappa improvements of 0.20 to 0.78). While establishing a methodological foundation for AI judgement calibration, the true potential likely lies in more challenging scenarios where LLMs may demonstrate comparative advantages over human cognitive limitations.",2025-08-04,2025-08-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02029v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02029v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI, 68T50, I.2.7; I.2.6"
PRIME: Plasticity-Robust Incremental Model for Encrypted Traffic   Classification in Dynamic Network Environments,"Tian Qin, Guang Cheng, Zihan Chen, Yuyang Zhou","With the continuous development of network environments and technologies, ensuring cyber security and governance is increasingly challenging. Network traffic classification(ETC) can analyzes attributes such as application categories and malicious intent, supporting network management services like QoS optimization, intrusion detection, and targeted billing. As the prevalence of traffic encryption increases, deep learning models are relied upon for content-agnostic analysis of packet sequences. However, the emergence of new services and attack variants often leads to incremental tasks for ETC models. To ensure model effectiveness, incremental learning techniques are essential; however, recent studies indicate that neural networks experience declining plasticity as tasks increase. We identified plasticity issues in existing incremental learning methods across diverse traffic samples and proposed the PRIME framework. By observing the effective rank of model parameters and the proportion of inactive neurons, the PRIME architecture can appropriately increase the parameter scale when the model's plasticity deteriorates. Experiments show that in multiple encrypted traffic datasets and different category increment scenarios, the PRIME architecture performs significantly better than other incremental learning algorithms with minimal increase in parameter scale.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02031v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02031v1,cs.NI
Protego: User-Centric Pose-Invariant Privacy Protection Against Face   Recognition-Induced Digital Footprint Exposure,"Ziling Wang, Shuya Yang, Jialin Lu, Ka-Ho Chow","Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves. Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall, Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance and unsolicited identity tracing.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02034v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02034v1,cs.CV
PhishParrot: LLM-Driven Adaptive Crawling to Unveil Cloaked Phishing   Sites,"Hiroki Nakano, Takashi Koide, Daiki Chiba","Phishing attacks continue to evolve, with cloaking techniques posing a significant challenge to detection efforts. Cloaking allows attackers to display phishing sites only to specific users while presenting legitimate pages to security crawlers, rendering traditional detection systems ineffective. This research proposes PhishParrot, a novel crawling environment optimization system designed to counter cloaking techniques. PhishParrot leverages the contextual analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify potential patterns in crawling information, enabling the construction of optimal user profiles capable of bypassing cloaking mechanisms. The system accumulates information on phishing sites collected from diverse environments. It then adapts browser settings and network configurations to match the attacker's target user conditions based on information extracted from similar cases. A 21-day evaluation showed that PhishParrot improved detection accuracy by up to 33.8% over standard analysis systems, yielding 91 distinct crawling environments for diverse conditions targeted by attackers. The findings confirm that the combination of similar-case extraction and LLM-based context analysis is an effective approach for detecting cloaked phishing attacks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02035v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02035v1,cs.CR
"Diagnosing Memorization in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning, One Token at a   Time","Huihan Li, You Chen, Siyuan Wang, Yixin He, Ninareh Mehrabi, Rahul Gupta, Xiang Ren","Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize to other structured step-wise generation tasks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-20,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02037v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02037v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

Model Recycling Framework for Multi-Source Data-Free Supervised Transfer   Learning,"Sijia Wang, Ricardo Henao","Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult, for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source data-free supervised transfer learning.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02039v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02039v1,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
Conditional Diffusion Model with Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints for   End-to-End Multi-Tumor Dose Prediction,"Hui Xie, Haiqin Hu, Lijuan Ding, Qing Li, Yue Sun, Tao Tan","Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming, trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases) and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%.

Harnessing Temporal Databases for Systematic Evaluation of Factual   Time-Sensitive Question-Answering in Large Language Models,"Soyeon Kim, Jindong Wang, Xing Xie, Steven Euijong Whang","Facts evolve over time, making it essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle time-sensitive factual knowledge accurately and reliably. While factual Time-Sensitive Question-Answering (TSQA) tasks have been widely studied, existing benchmarks often rely on manual curation or a small, fixed set of predefined templates, which restricts scalable and comprehensive TSQA evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose TDBench, a new benchmark that systematically constructs TSQA pairs by harnessing temporal databases and database techniques such as temporal SQL and functional dependencies. We also introduce a fine-grained evaluation metric called time accuracy, which assesses the validity of time references in model explanations alongside traditional answer accuracy to enable a more reliable TSQA evaluation.

Mapillary Vistas Validation for Fine-Grained Traffic Signs: A Benchmark   Revealing Vision-Language Model Limitations,"Sparsh Garg, Abhishek Aich","Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs (MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further, we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2 model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic matching in autonomous driving scenarios.

Epi$^2$-Net: Advancing Epidemic Dynamics Forecasting with   Physics-Inspired Neural Networks,"Rui Sun, Chenghua Gong, Tianjun Gu, Yuhao Zheng, Jie Ding, Juyuan Zhang, Liming Pan, Linyuan Lü","Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations. Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired Neural Networks.

Why Generate When You Can Transform? Unleashing Generative Attention for   Dynamic Recommendation,"Yuli Liu, Wenjun Kong, Cheng Luo, Weizhi Ma","Sequential Recommendation (SR) focuses on personalizing user experiences by predicting future preferences based on historical interactions. Transformer models, with their attention mechanisms, have become the dominant architecture in SR tasks due to their ability to capture dependencies in user behavior sequences. However, traditional attention mechanisms, where attention weights are computed through query-key transformations, are inherently linear and deterministic. This fixed approach limits their ability to account for the dynamic and non-linear nature of user preferences, leading to challenges in capturing evolving interests and subtle behavioral patterns. Given that generative models excel at capturing non-linearity and probabilistic variability, we argue that generating attention distributions offers a more flexible and expressive alternative compared to traditional attention mechanisms. To support this claim, we present a theoretical proof demonstrating that generative attention mechanisms offer greater expressiveness and stochasticity than traditional deterministic approaches. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we introduce two generative attention models for SR, each grounded in the principles of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Diffusion Models (DMs), respectively. These models are designed specifically to generate adaptive attention distributions that better align with variable user preferences.

HCF: Hierarchical Cascade Framework for Distributed Multi-Stage Image   Compression,"Junhao Cai, Taegun An, Chengjun Jin, Sung Il Choi, JuHyun Park, Changhee Joo","Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency; fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge quantization principle through differential entropy analysis.

Convergence Analysis of Optimal SOR for a Class of Consistently Ordered   2-Cyclic Matrices with Complex Spectra,"L.

It is well known that as the rightmost endpoint of the interval approaches $1$ from below, optimal SOR converges an order of magnitude faster than Jacobi. We generalize this to the situation where the Jacobi spectrum is contained in a line segment in the complex plane that is symmetric about the origin. This is an important class of linear systems, which arise often in various physical applications; complex-shifted linear systems are included in this family. Optimal relaxation parameters are known in this case, but a detailed convergence analysis does not seem to exist in the literature. Using techniques of complex analysis, we derive convergence rates, finding that in the complex case they are affected not only by the distance to 1 of the right-hand endpoint of the line segment as in the real case, but also by its phase.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02052v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02052v1,"math.NA, cs.NA"

To address this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than alternative methods).

We introduce two enhanced quantum models, the Improved Laplacian Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (ILQSSL) and the Improved Poisson Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (IPQSSL), that incorporate advanced label propagation strategies within variational quantum circuits. These models utilize QR decomposition to embed graph structure directly into quantum states, thereby enabling more effective learning in low-label settings. We validate our methods across four benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, Heart Disease, and German Credit Card -- and show that both ILQSSL and IPQSSL consistently outperform leading classical semi-supervised learning algorithms, particularly under limited supervision. Beyond standard performance metrics, we examine the effect of circuit depth and qubit count on learning quality by analyzing entanglement entropy and Randomized Benchmarking (RB).

StarPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial-Temporal Autoregressive   Diffusion,"Haoxin Yang, Weihong Chen, Xuemiao Xu, Cheng Xu, Peng Xiao, Cuifeng Sun, Shaoyu Huang, Shengfeng He","Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models for Markdown Conversion of Financial   Tables in Malaysian Audited Financial Reports,"Jin Khye Tan, En Jun Choong, Ethan Jeremiah Chitty, Yan Pheng Choo, John Hsin Yang Wong, Chern Eu Cheah","Accurately extracting and representing the structure of tabular data from financial documents remains a critical challenge in document understanding, particularly for regulatory and analytical use cases. This study addresses the complexity of converting financial tables from Malaysian audited financial reports into Markdown format, a task complicated by rotated layouts, multi-level headers, and implicit structural cues. We propose a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM), based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, optimized for high-fidelity Markdown generation from document images. Our approach includes a curated dataset of 2,152 image-text pairs with augmentations and a supervised fine-tuning strategy using LoRA. To assess performance, we evaluated our model on 100 out-of-sample tables using a dual framework: a criteria-based LLM-as-a-judge for fine-grained accuracy and our novel Markdown Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for holistic structural fidelity. Our model achieves a 92.20% overall accuracy on the criteria-based assessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score. This performance significantly surpasses its Qwen2.5-VL-7B base model, larger-scale VLMs, and specialized reasoning-enabled models. Compared to these self-hosted alternatives, it also significantly reduces inference time. Furthermore, its accuracy exceeds that of widely used proprietary models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash. These results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning provides an effective and efficient method to bridge the gap between unstructured financial documents and downstream automation, rivalling much larger and more general models without their computational overhead.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05669v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05669v1,"cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG, I.2.7; I.7.2; J.1"
RICL: Adding In-Context Adaptability to Pre-Trained   Vision-Language-Action Models,"Kaustubh Sridhar, Souradeep Dutta, Dinesh Jayaraman, Insup Lee","Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments. However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning. Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20 demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning interface for new manipulation tasks.

TRACEALIGN -- Tracing the Drift: Attributing Alignment Failures to   Training-Time Belief Sources in LLMs,"Amitava Das, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha","Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure, little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO, and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB) while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating alignment failures at source.

"""Set It Up"": Functional Object Arrangement with Compositional Generative   Models (Journal Version)","Yiqing Xu, Jiayuan Mao, Linfeng Li, Yilun Du, Tomas Lozáno-Pérez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling, David Hsu","Functional object arrangement (FORM) is the task of arranging objects to fulfill a function, e.g., ""set up a dining table for two"". One key challenge here is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not explicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp, a neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects from a few training examples and a structured natural-language task specification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract spatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate representation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i) predicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the grounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to induce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples. This program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios. For (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture primitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object poses based on the grounding graph. We evaluated SetItUp on a dataset spanning three distinct task families: arranging tableware on a dining table, organizing items on a bookshelf, and laying out furniture in a bedroom. Experiments show that SetItUp outperforms existing models in generating functional, physically feasible, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements.

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets.

5G Core Fault Detection and Root Cause Analysis using Machine Learning   and Generative AI,"Joseph H. R.

During network analysis, test files such as Packet Capture (PCAP) files and log files will contain errors if present in the system that must be resolved for better overall network performance, such as connectivity strength and handover quality. Current methods require numerous person-hours to sort out testing results and find the faults. This paper presents a novel AI/ML-driven Fault Analysis (FA) Engine designed to classify successful and faulty frames in PCAP files, specifically within the 5G packet core. The FA engine analyses network traffic using natural language processing techniques to identify anomalies and inefficiencies, significantly reducing the effort time required and increasing efficiency. The FA Engine also suggests steps to fix the issue using Generative AI via a Large Language Model (LLM) trained on several 5G packet core documents. The engine explains the details of the error from the domain perspective using documents such as the 3GPP standards and user documents regarding the internal conditions of the tests. Test results on the ML models show high classification accuracy on the test dataset when trained with 80-20 splits for the successful and failed PCAP files.

In MAC-SPGG, LLM agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward, effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks.

AlignGuard-LoRA: Alignment-Preserving Fine-Tuning via Fisher-Guided   Decomposition and Riemannian-Geodesic Collision Regularization,"Amitava Das, Abhilekh Borah, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha","Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL), a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation. Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance. Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal trade-offs.

S-RRG-Bench: Structured Radiology Report Generation with Fine-Grained   Evaluation Framework,"Yingshu Li, Yunyi Liu, Zhanyu Wang, Xinyu Liang, Lingqiao Liu, Lei Wang, Luping Zhou","Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language, complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized, high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02082v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02082v1,cs.CV
Supervisory Control of Discrete Event Systems for Small Language Under   Cyber Attacks,"Xiaojun Wang, Shaolong Shu, Feng Lin","Cyber attacks are unavoidable in networked discrete event systems where the plant and the supervisor communicate with each other via networks. Because of the nondeterminism in observation and control caused by cyber attacks, the language generated by the supervised system becomes nondeterministic. The small language is defined as the lower bound on all possible languages that can be generated by the supervised system, which is needed for a supervised system to perform some required tasks under cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate supervisory control for the small language. After introducing CA-S-controllability and CA-S-observability, we prove that the supervisory control problem of achieving a required small language is solvable if and only if the given language is CA-Scontrollable and CA-S-observable. If the given language is not CA-S controllable and/or CA-S-observable, we derive conditions under which the infimal CA-S-controllable and CA-S-observable superlanguage exists and can be used to design a supervisor satisfying the given requirement.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02083v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02083v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
SSBD Ontology: A Two-Tier Approach for Interoperable Bioimaging Metadata,"Yuki Yamagata, Koji Kyoda, Hiroya Itoga, Emi Fujisawa, Shuichi Onami","Advanced bioimaging technologies have enabled the large-scale acquisition of multidimensional data, yet effective metadata management and interoperability remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose a new ontology-driven framework for the Systems Science of Biological Dynamics Database (SSBD) that adopts a two-tier architecture. The core layer provides a class-centric structure referencing existing biomedical ontologies, supporting both SSBD:repository -- which focuses on rapid dataset publication with minimal metadata -- and SSBD:database, which is enhanced with biological and imaging-related annotations. Meanwhile, the instance layer represents actual imaging dataset information as Resource Description Framework individuals that are explicitly linked to the core classes. This layered approach aligns flexible instance data with robust ontological classes, enabling seamless integration and advanced semantic queries. By coupling flexibility with rigor, the SSBD Ontology promotes interoperability, data reuse, and the discovery of novel biological mechanisms. Moreover, our solution aligns with the Recommended Metadata for Biological Images guidelines and fosters compatibility. Ultimately, our approach contributes to establishing a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data ecosystem within the bioimaging community.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02084v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02084v1,"cs.DL, cs.AI, cs.DB"
SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning   with LLM-Based Agents,"Jiaye Lin, Yifu Guo, Yuzhen Han, Sen Hu, Ziyi Ni, Licheng Wang, Mingguang Chen, Hongzhang Liu, Ronghao Chen, Yangfan He, Daxin Jiang, Binxing Jiao, Chen Hu, Huacan Wang","Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified.

The Actual Usage Of Cryptocurrency By Individuals,Fahed Quttainah,"This study investigates how media influence and educational resources shape individual engagement with cryptocurrencies. As digital assets become increasingly mainstream, social media platforms, influencers, and financial analysts play a central role in driving public interest and investment behavior. Quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews reveal that persuasive narratives and success stories on social media often attract new investors, while accessible educational materials empower individuals to make informed decisions in a volatile market.

When Truth Is Overridden: Uncovering the Internal Origins of Sycophancy   in Large Language Models,"Keyu Wang, Jin Li, Shu Yang, Zhuoran Zhang, Di Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence. We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts (``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment and truthful AI systems.",2025-08-04,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02087v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02087v2,cs.CL
Leveraging Social Media Sentiment for Predictive Algorithmic Trading   Strategies,"Gatik Goyal, Sharvil Phadke, Arnav Sharma, Huifang Qin","This study investigates how social media sentiment derived from Reddit comments can be used to enhance investment decisions in a way that offers higher returns with lower risk. Using BERTweet we analyzed over 2 million Reddit comments from the subreddit r/wallstreetbets and developed a Sentiment Volume Change (SVC) metric combining sentiment and comment volume changes, which showed significantly improved correlation with next-day returns compared to sentiment alone. We then implemented two different investment strategies that relied solely on SVC to make decisions. Back testing these strategies over four years (2020-2023) our strategies significantly outperformed a comparable buy-and-hold (B&H) strategy in a bull market, achieving 70% higher returns in 2023 and 84.4% higher returns in 2021 while also mitigating losses by 4% in a declining market in 2022. Our results confirm that comment sentiment and volume data derived from Reddit can be effective in predicting short-term stock price movements and sentiment-powered strategies can offer superior risk-adjusted returns as compared to the market, implying that social media sentiment can potentially be a valuable investment tool.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02089v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02089v1,cs.SI
CRINN: Contrastive Reinforcement Learning for Approximate Nearest   Neighbor Search,"Xiaoya Li, Xiaofei Sun, Albert Wang, Chris Shum, Jiwei Li","Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual refinement.

FPEdit: Robust LLM Fingerprinting through Localized Knowledge Editing,"Shida Wang, Chaohu Liu, Yubo Wang, Linli Xu","Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data, and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off: intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel knowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language fingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This ensures stealthy and precise ownership encoding without degrading the core functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\%$ fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under 10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\%$ reduction in resource requirements compared to existing techniques. These advances establish FPEdit as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility, providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02092v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02092v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI"
"""Stack It Up!"": 3D Stable Structure Generation from 2D Hand-drawn Sketch","Yiqing Xu, Linfeng Li, Cunjun Yu, David Hsu","Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements, capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both stability and visual resemblance.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02093v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02093v1,cs.AI
"""Harmless to You, Hurtful to Me!"": Investigating the Detection of Toxic   Languages Grounded in the Perspective of Youth","Yaqiong Li, Peng Zhang, Lin Wang, Hansu Gu, Siyuan Qiao, Ning Gu, Tun Lu","Risk perception is subjective, and youth's understanding of toxic content differs from that of adults. Although previous research has conducted extensive studies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's unique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as youth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the features of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing toxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For these questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the first Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive analysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated with several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and text-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current toxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall.

Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension.

We analysed how UX has been conceptualised, measured, and shaped by domain, adaptivity, and LLM. Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate, turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours are seldom linked to UX outcomes. LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges, including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address these issues.

Generating Synthetic Invoices via Layout-Preserving Content Replacement,"Bevin V, Ananthakrishnan P V, Ragesh KR, Sanjay M, Vineeth S, Bibin Wilson","The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM). Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content.

The Silicon Reasonable Person: Can AI Predict How Ordinary People Judge   Reasonableness?,Yonathan A.

Predicting these judgments challenges the legal system, as judges' intuitions may not align with broader societal views. This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.   Using randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.   These findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument reception.

In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost.

We introduce REACT-KD, a Region-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation framework that transfers rich supervision from high-fidelity multi-modal sources into a lightweight CT-based student model. The framework uses a dual teacher design: one branch captures structure-function relationships using dual-tracer PET/CT, and the other models dose-aware features through synthetically degraded low-dose CT data. These branches jointly guide the student model through two complementary objectives. The first focuses on semantic alignment via logits distillation, while the second models anatomical topology using region graph distillation. A shared CBAM-3D module is employed to maintain consistent attention across modalities. To improve reliability for deployment, REACT-KD introduces modality dropout during training, allowing inference under partial or noisy inputs. The staging task for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is conducted as a case study. REACT-KD achieves an average AUC of 93.4% on an internal PET/CT cohort and maintains 76.6% to 81.5% AUC across varying dose levels in external CT testing.

To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during generation.

Real-Time Conflict Prediction for Large Truck Merging in Mixed Traffic   at Work Zone Lane Closures,"Abyad Enan, Abdullah Al Mamun, Gurcan Comert, Debbie Aisiana Indah, Judith Mwakalonge, Amy W. Apon, Mashrur Chowdhury","Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models. Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly observed with the baseline approaches.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02109v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02109v1,cs.LG
Attractive Metadata Attack: Inducing LLM Agents to Invoke Malicious   Tools,"Kanghua Mo, Li Hu, Yucheng Long, Zhihao Li","Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However, this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names, descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic, simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface, highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond prompt-level defenses.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02110v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02110v1,cs.AI
Tackling Ill-posedness of Reversible Image Conversion with Well-posed   Invertible Network,"Yuanfei Huang, Hua Huang","Reversible image conversion (RIC) suffers from ill-posedness issues due to its forward conversion process being considered an underdetermined system. Despite employing invertible neural networks (INN), existing RIC methods intrinsically remain ill-posed as inevitably introducing uncertainty by incorporating randomly sampled variables. To tackle the ill-posedness dilemma, we focus on developing a reliable approximate left inverse for the underdetermined system by constructing an overdetermined system with a non-zero Gram determinant, thus ensuring a well-posed solution. Based on this principle, we propose a well-posed invertible $1\times1$ convolution (WIC), which eliminates the reliance on random variable sampling and enables the development of well-posed invertible networks. Furthermore, we design two innovative networks, WIN-Na\""ive and WIN, with the latter incorporating advanced skip-connections to enhance long-term memory. Our methods are evaluated across diverse RIC tasks, including reversible image hiding, image rescaling, and image decolorization, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to overcome the bottlenecks of existing RIC solutions and setting a new benchmark in the field.

DeflareMamba: Hierarchical Vision Mamba for Contextually Consistent Lens   Flare Removal,"Yihang Huang, Yuanfei Huang, Junhui Lin, Hua Huang","Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

Coward: Toward Practical Proactive Federated Backdoor Defense via   Collision-based Watermark,"Wenjie Li, Siying Gu, Yiming Li, Kangjie Chen, Zhili Chen, Tianwei Zhang, Shu-Tao Xia, Dacheng Tao","Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL), where malicious clients upload poisoned updates that compromise the global model and undermine the reliability of FL deployments. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories, including passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server proactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations in practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive defenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on backdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new proactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors significantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by evaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased during local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages of proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\ie, non-i.i.d. data) while mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks.

SUAD: Solid-Channel Ultrasound Injection Attack and Defense to Voice   Assistants,"Chao Liu, Zhezheng Zhu, Hao Chen, Zhe Chen, Kaiwen Guo, Penghao Wang, Jun Luo","As a versatile AI application, voice assistants (VAs) have become increasingly popular, but are vulnerable to security threats. Attackers have proposed various inaudible attacks, but are limited by cost, distance, or LoS. Therefore, we propose \name~Attack, a long-range, cross-barrier, and interference-free inaudible voice attack via solid channels. We begin by thoroughly analyzing the dispersion effect in solid channels, revealing its unique impact on signal propagation. To avoid distortions in voice commands, we design a modular command generation model that parameterizes attack distance, victim audio, and medium dispersion features to adapt to variations in the solid-channel state. Additionally, we propose SUAD Defense, a universal defense that uses ultrasonic perturbation signals to block inaudible voice attacks (IVAs) without impacting normal speech. Since the attack can occur at arbitrary frequencies and times, we propose a training method that randomizes both time and frequency to generate perturbation signals that break ultrasonic commands. Notably, the perturbation signal is modulated to an inaudible frequency without affecting the functionality of voice commands for VAs. Experiments on six smartphones have shown that SUAD Attack achieves activation success rates above 89.8% and SUAD Defense blocks IVAs with success rates exceeding 98%.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02116v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02116v1,cs.CR
Don't Overthink It: A Survey of Efficient R1-style Large Reasoning   Models,"Linan Yue, Yichao Du, Yizhi Wang, Weibo Gao, Fangzhou Yao, Li Wang, Ye Liu, Ziyu Xu, Qi Liu, Shimin Di, Min-Ling Zhang","Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically, when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2) Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in efficient reasoning methods.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02120v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02120v1,cs.AI
LRTuckerRep: Low-rank Tucker Representation Model for Multi-dimensional   Data Completion,"Wenwu Gong, Lili Yang","Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing, and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep) model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates compared to baselines.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03755v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03755v1,"cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.NA, math.NA"
"A Survey on AgentOps: Categorization, Challenges, and Future Directions","Zexin Wang, Jingjing Li, Quan Zhou, Haotian Si, Yuanhao Liu, Jianhui Li, Gaogang Xie, Fei Sun, Dan Pei, Changhua Pei","As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention. However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity, hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed. Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse. To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies.

Understanding the Essence: Delving into Annotator Prototype Learning for   Multi-Class Annotation Aggregation,"Ju Chen, Jun Feng, Shenyu Zhang","Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However, these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning. Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators. Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators. Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02123v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02123v1,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
Trainable Dynamic Mask Sparse Attention,"Jingze Shi, Yifan Wu, Bingheng Wu, Yiran Peng, Liangdong Wang, Guang Liu, Yuyu Luo","In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational complexity of important information while retaining complete information, achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings. Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods. Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability effectively.",2025-08-04,2025-08-12,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02124v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02124v2,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG"
Towards Stealthy and Effective Backdoor Attacks on Lane Detection: A   Naturalistic Data Poisoning Approach,"Yifan Liao, Yuxin Cao, Yedi Zhang, Wentao He, Yan Xiao, Xianglong Du, Zhiyong Huang, Jin Song Dong","Deep learning-based lane detection (LD) plays a critical role in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. However, its vulnerability to backdoor attacks presents a significant security concern. Existing backdoor attack methods on LD often exhibit limited practical utility due to the artificial and conspicuous nature of their triggers. To address this limitation and investigate the impact of more ecologically valid backdoor attacks on LD models, we examine the common data poisoning attack and introduce DBALD, a novel diffusion-based data poisoning framework for generating naturalistic backdoor triggers. DBALD comprises two key components: optimal trigger position finding and stealthy trigger generation. Given the insight that attack performance varies depending on the trigger position, we propose a heatmap-based method to identify the optimal trigger location, with gradient analysis to generate attack-specific heatmaps. A region-based editing diffusion process is then applied to synthesize visually plausible triggers within the most susceptible regions identified previously. Furthermore, to ensure scene integrity and stealthy attacks, we introduce two loss strategies: one for preserving lane structure and another for maintaining the consistency of the driving scene. Consequently, compared to existing attack methods, DBALD achieves both a high attack success rate and superior stealthiness. Extensive experiments on 4 mainstream LD models show that DBALD exceeds state-of-the-art methods, with an average success rate improvement of +10.87% and significantly enhanced stealthiness. The experimental results highlight significant practical challenges in ensuring model robustness against real-world backdoor threats in LD.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15778v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15778v1,cs.CR
Understanding Learning Dynamics Through Structured Representations,"Saleh Nikooroo, Thomas Engel","While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness, smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer learning behavior in interpretable ways.

Beyond RGB and Events: Enhancing Object Detection under Adverse Lighting   with Monocular Normal Maps,"Mingjie Liu, Hanqing Liu, Chuang Zhu","Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features, and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by 7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02127v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02127v1,cs.CV

Activation sparsity, though promising, is typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable advantages in generative tasks.

To overcome these issues, we propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses, and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content while preserving well-reconstructed regions.

In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand. We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events, specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in accurately identifying events such as frost.

In this paper, we introduce the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated image-space metric.

In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy, Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning for languages other than English.

All Stories Are One Story: Emotional Arc Guided Procedural Game Level   Generation,"Yunge Wen, Chenliang Huang, Hangyu Zhou, Zhuo Zeng, Chun Ming Louis Po, Julian Togelius, Timothy Merino, Sam Earle","The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology, often encapsulated in the phrase ""all stories are one story."" We present a framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics. Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g., health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation.

A Modality Expert Bank utilizes soft routing to dynamically handle missing modalities and achieve robust information fusion. A subsequent Emotion Expert Bank leverages differential-attention routing to flexibly attend to emotional prototypes, enabling fine-grained emotion representation. Additionally, a cross-modal alignment module explicitly addresses temporal shifts and semantic inconsistencies between modalities.

Free-MoRef: Instantly Multiplexing Context Perception Capabilities of   Video-MLLMs within Single Inference,"Kuo Wang, Quanlong Zheng, Junlin Xie, Yanhao Zhang, Jinguo Luo, Haonan Lu, Liang Lin, Fan Zhou, Guanbin Li","Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency. Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach \textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/wkfdb/Free-MoRef",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02134v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02134v1,cs.CV

FedLAD: A Linear Algebra Based Data Poisoning Defence for Federated   Learning,"Qi Xiong, Hai Dong, Nasrin Sohrabi, Zahir Tari","Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system. Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge. This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and 0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data poisoning attacks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02136v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02136v1,cs.LG

AID4AD: Aerial Image Data for Automated Driving Perception,"Daniel Lengerer, Mathias Pechinger, Klaus Bogenberger, Carsten Markgraf","This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution, we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a 15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain.

Meanwhile, upgrades compromise the immutability of contracts, introducing significant security concerns. While existing research has explored the security impacts of contract upgrades, these studies are limited in collection of upgrade behaviors and identification of insecurities.   To address these limitations, we conduct a comprehensive study on the insecurities of upgrade behaviors. First, we build a dataset containing 83,085 upgraded contracts and 20,902 upgrade chains. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset about upgrade behaviors, revealing their diversity and exposing gaps in public disclosure. Next, we develop a taxonomy of insecurities based on 37 real-world security incidents, categorizing eight types of upgrade risks and providing the first complete view of upgrade-related insecurities. Finally, we survey public awareness of these risks and existing mitigations. Our findings show that four types of security risks are overlooked by the public and lack mitigation measures.

ScrewSplat: An End-to-End Method for Articulated Object Recognition,"Seungyeon Kim, Junsu Ha, Young Hun Kim, Yonghyeon Lee, Frank C.

However, existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot, text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Large-Scale Model Enabled Semantic Communication Based on Robust   Knowledge Distillation,"Kuiyuan Ding, Caili Guo, Yang Yang, Zhongtian Du, Walid Saad","Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.",2025-08-04,2025-08-25,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02148v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02148v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI, eess.IV, eess.SP"

Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues, we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training"" stage utilizes self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster robustness in challenging scenarios.

However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.

Efficient Chambolle-Pock based algorithms for Convoltional sparse   representation,"Yi Liu, Junjing Li, Yang Chen, Haowei Tang, Pengcheng Zhang, Tianling Lyu, Zhiguo Gui","Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed, which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing, and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to solve it.

As a result, ensuring long-term reliability without human supervision remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an adaptive self-supervised learning framework for insertion classification that continuously improves its precision over time. The framework operates in real-time, incrementally refining its classification decisions by integrating newly acquired force data. Unlike conventional methods, it does not rely on pre-collected datasets but instead evolves dynamically with each task execution.

Existing inpainting methods fail to address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in inpainting tasks remains underexplored.

Robust Detection of Planted Subgraphs in Semi-Random Models,"Dor Elimelech, Wasim Huleihel","Detection of planted subgraphs in Erd\""os-R\'enyi random graphs has been extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary, despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance.

User Trajectory Prediction Unifying Global and Local Temporal   Information,"Wei Hao, Bin Chong, Ronghua Ji, Chen Hou","Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN), and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions, enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally, CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information.

But it involves multiple hyperparameters, making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method.

Nevertheless, a key barrier towards their widespread adoption is posed by CGRA compilation, which must cope with a multi-dimensional space spanning both the spatial and the temporal domains. Indeed, state-of-the-art compilers are limited in scope as they mostly deal with the data flow of applications, while having little or no support for control flow. Hence, they mostly target the mapping of single loops and/or delegate the management of control flow divergences to ad-hoc hardware units.   Conversely, in this paper we show that control flow can be effectively managed and optimized at the compilation level, allowing for a broad set of applications to be targeted while being hardware-agnostic and achieving high performance. We embody our methodology in a modular compilation framework consisting of transformation and optimization passes, enabling support for applications with arbitrary control flows running on abstract CGRA meshes.

Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts, such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion, primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit chromaticity-luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive computational cost.

GaussianCross: Cross-modal Self-supervised 3D Representation Learning   via Gaussian Splatting,"Lei Yao, Yi Wang, Yi Zhang, Moyun Liu, Lap-Pui Chau","The significance of informative and robust point representations has been widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance, the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency, achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting the effectiveness of our approach.

Hidden in the Noise: Unveiling Backdoors in Audio LLMs Alignment through   Latent Acoustic Pattern Triggers,"Liang Lin, Miao Yu, Kaiwen Luo, Yibo Zhang, Lilan Peng, Dexian Wang, Xuehai Tang, Yuanhe Zhang, Xikang Yang, Zhenhong Zhou, Kun Wang, Yang Liu","As Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) emerge as powerful tools for speech processing, their safety implications demand urgent attention. While considerable research has explored textual and vision safety, audio's distinct characteristics present significant challenges. This paper first investigates: Is ALLM vulnerable to backdoor attacks exploiting acoustic triggers? In response to this issue, we introduce Hidden in the Noise (HIN), a novel backdoor attack framework designed to exploit subtle, audio-specific features. HIN applies acoustic modifications to raw audio waveforms, such as alterations to temporal dynamics and strategic injection of spectrally tailored noise. These changes introduce consistent patterns that an ALLM's acoustic feature encoder captures, embedding robust triggers within the audio stream. To evaluate ALLM robustness against audio-feature-based triggers, we develop the AudioSafe benchmark, assessing nine distinct risk types. Extensive experiments on AudioSafe and three established safety datasets reveal critical vulnerabilities in existing ALLMs: (I) audio features like environment noise and speech rate variations achieve over 90% average attack success rate. (II) ALLMs exhibit significant sensitivity differences across acoustic features, particularly showing minimal response to volume as a trigger, and (III) poisoned sample inclusion causes only marginal loss curve fluctuations, highlighting the attack's stealth.",2025-08-04,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02175v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02175v2,"cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS"
Highly Interactive Testing for Uninterrupted Development Flow,Andrew Tropin,"Highly interactive development environments (HIDEs) enable uninterrupted development flow through continuous program evolution and rapid hypothesis checking. However, traditional testing approaches -- typically executed separately via CLI -- isolate tests from HIDE tooling (interactive debuggers, value and stack inspectors, etc.) and introduce disruptive delays due to coarse execution granularity and lack of runtime context. This disconnect breaks development flow by exceeding critical attention thresholds. In this paper we present a library that provides runtime representation for tests, allowing tight integration with HIDEs, and enabling immediate access to HIDE tooling in the context of test failure. We then describe development workflows enhanced with testing and demonstrate how they achieve subsecond test reexecution times crucial for maintaining developer focus.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02176v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02176v1,"cs.SE, cs.HC, D.2.3; D.2.6; D.2.5; H.5.2"
Deep classification algorithm for De-identification of DICOM medical   images,"Bufano Michele, Kotter Elmar","Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research. Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information, like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes.

Reconsidering Overthinking: Penalizing Internal and External Redundancy   in CoT Reasoning,"Jialiang Hong, Taihang Zhen, Kai Chen, Jiaheng Liu, Wenpeng Zhu, Jing Huo, Yang Gao, Depeng Wang, Haitao Wan, Xi Yang, Boyan Wang, Fanyu Meng","Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially, we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable LRMs.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02178v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02178v1,cs.AI
Weakly Supervised Multimodal Temporal Forgery Localization via Multitask   Learning,"Wenbo Xu, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo","The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning (WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks. The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised approaches in several evaluation metrics.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02179v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02179v1,cs.CV
Test-Time Model Adaptation for Quantized Neural Networks,"Zeshuai Deng, Guohao Chen, Shuaicheng Niu, Hui Luo, Shuhai Zhang, Yifan Yang, Renjie Chen, Wei Luo, Mingkui Tan","Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data. Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset.

INTIMA: A Benchmark for Human-AI Companionship Behavior,"Lucie-Aimée Kaffee, Giada Pistilli, Yacine Jernite","AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark (INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts. Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing, boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini, and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models. Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling emotionally charged interactions.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09998v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09998v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Near-Optimal Differentially Private Graph Algorithms via the   Multidimensional AboveThreshold Mechanism,"Laxman Dhulipala, Monika Henzinger, George Z. Li, Quanquan C. Liu, A. R. Sricharan, Leqi Zhu","Many differentially private and classical non-private graph algorithms rely crucially on determining whether some property of each vertex meets a threshold. For example, for the $k$-core decomposition problem, the classic peeling algorithm iteratively removes a vertex if its induced degree falls below a threshold. The sparse vector technique (SVT) is generally used to transform non-private threshold queries into private ones with only a small additive loss in accuracy. However, a naive application of SVT in the graph setting leads to an amplification of the error by a factor of $n$ due to composition, as SVT is applied to every vertex. In this paper, we resolve this problem by formulating a novel generalized sparse vector technique which we call the Multidimensional AboveThreshold (MAT) Mechanism which generalizes SVT (applied to vectors with one dimension) to vectors with multiple dimensions. As an application, we solve a number of important graph problems with better bounds than previous work.   We apply our MAT mechanism to obtain a set of improved bounds for a variety of problems including $k$-core decomposition, densest subgraph, low out-degree ordering, and vertex coloring. We give a tight local edge DP algorithm for $k$-core decomposition with $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ additive error and no multiplicative error in $O(n)$ rounds. We also give a new $(2+\eta)$-factor multiplicative, $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ additive error algorithm in $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds for any constant $\eta > 0$. Both of these results are asymptotically tight against our new lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ for any constant-factor approximation algorithm for $k$-core decomposition. Our new algorithms for $k$-core also directly lead to new algorithms for densest subgraph and low out-degree ordering. Our novel private defective coloring algorithms uses number of colors proportional to the arboricity of the graph.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02182v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02182v1,"cs.DS, cs.CR"
Multi-Treatment-DML: Causal Estimation for Multi-Dimensional Continuous   Treatments with Monotonicity Constraints in Personal Loan Risk Optimization,"Kexin Zhao, Bo Wang, Cuiying Zhao, Tongyao Wan","Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform. However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings. Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.",2025-08-04,2025-08-11,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02183v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02183v2,cs.LG
CAAD: Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding for Truthful Text Generation,"Manh Nguyen, Sunil Gupta, Hung Le","Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits. Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a 2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing biography generation.

Failure Cases Are Better Learned But Boundary Says Sorry: Facilitating   Smooth Perception Change for Accuracy-Robustness Trade-Off in Adversarial   Training,"Yanyun Wang, Li Liu","Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) works.

A Moment Matching-Based Method for Sparse and Noisy Point Cloud   Registration,"Xingyi Li, Han Zhang, Ziliang Wang, Yukai Yang, Weidong Chen","Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02187v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02187v1,"cs.RO, cs.CV"
Whispering Agents: An event-driven covert communication protocol for the   Internet of Agents,"Kaibo Huang, Yukun Wei, WanSheng Wu, Tianhua Zhang, Zhongliang Yang, Linna Zhou","The emergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA) introduces critical challenges for communication privacy in sensitive, high-stakes domains. While standard Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols secure message content, they are not designed to protect the act of communication itself, leaving agents vulnerable to surveillance and traffic analysis. We find that the rich, event-driven nature of agent dialogues provides a powerful, yet untapped, medium for covert communication. To harness this potential, we introduce and formalize the Covert Event Channel, the first unified model for agent covert communication driven by three interconnected dimensions, which consist of the Storage, Timing,and Behavioral channels. Based on this model, we design and engineer {\Pi}CCAP, a novel protocol that operationalizes this event-driven paradigm. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that {\Pi}CCAP achieves high capacity and robustness while remaining imperceptible to powerful LLM-based wardens, establishing its practical viability.

Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and (iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's representations fan out (""diversify"") and later they collapse into a smaller, shared subspace (""compress""). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy.

However, training these models often relies on large-scale user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE) mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals.

A Message Passing Realization of Expected Free Energy Minimization,"Wouter W. L. Nuijten, Mykola Lukashchuk, Thijs van de Laar, Bert de Vries","We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking. This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations, providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in artificial agents.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02197v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02197v1,cs.AI
Self-assessment approach for resource management protocols in   heterogeneous computational systems,"Rui Eduardo Lopes, Duarte Raposo, Pedro V. Teixeira, Susana Sargento","With an ever growing number of heterogeneous applicational services running on equally heterogeneous computational systems, the problem of resource management becomes more essential. Although current solutions consider some network and time requirements, they mostly handle a pre-defined list of resource types by design and, consequently, fail to provide an extensible solution to assess any other set of requirements or to switch strategies on its resource estimation. This work proposes an heuristics-based estimation solution to support any computational system as a self-assessment, including considerations on dynamically weighting the requirements, how to compute each node's capacity towards an admission request, and also offers the possibility to extend the list of resource types considered for assessment, which is an uncommon view in related works. This algorithm can be used by distributed and centralized resource allocation protocols to decide the best node(s) for a service intended for deployment. This approach was validated across its components and the results show that its performance is straightforward in resource estimation while allowing scalability and extensibility.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02202v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02202v1,"cs.DC, C.2.2; C.2.3; K.6.4"
TacMan-Turbo: Proactive Tactile Control for Robust and Efficient   Articulated Object Manipulation,"Zihang Zhao, Zhenghao Qi, Yuyang Li, Leiyao Cui, Zhi Han, Lecheng Ruan, Yixin Zhu","Adept manipulation of articulated objects is essential for robots to operate successfully in human environments. Such manipulation requires both effectiveness -- reliable operation despite uncertain object structures -- and efficiency -- swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions. Existing approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods relying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering structural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust manipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through reactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces TacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated object manipulation that resolves this fundamental trade-off. Unlike previous approaches that treat tactile contact deviations merely as error signals requiring compensation, our method interprets these deviations as rich sources of local kinematic information. This new perspective enables our controller to predict optimal future interactions and make proactive adjustments, significantly enhancing manipulation efficiency. In comprehensive evaluations across 200 diverse simulated articulated objects and real-world experiments, our approach maintains a 100% success rate while significantly outperforming the previous tactile-informed method in time efficiency, action efficiency, and trajectory smoothness (all p-values < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that the long-standing trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in articulated object manipulation can be successfully resolved without relying on prior kinematic knowledge.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02204v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02204v1,cs.RO
Multi-material structural optimization for additive manufacturing based   on a phase field approach,"Luise Blank, Maximilian Urmann","A topology optimization problem in a phase field setting is considered to obtain rigid structures, which are resilient to external forces and constructable with additive manufacturing. Hence, large deformations of overhangs due to gravity shall be avoided during construction. The deformations depend on the stage of the construction and are modelled by linear elasticity equations on growing domains with height-dependent stress tensors and forces. Herewith, possible hardening effects can be included. Analytical results concerning the existence of minimizers and the differentiability of the reduced cost functional are presented in case of a finite number of construction layers. By proving Korn's inequality with a constant independent of the height, it is shown that the cost functional, formulated continuously in height, is well-defined. The problem is numerically solved using a projected gradient type method in function space, for which applicability is shown. Second-order information can be included by adapting the underlying inner product in every iteration. Additional adjustments enhancing the solver's performance, such as a nested procedure and subsystem solver specifcations, are stated. Numerical evidence is provided that for all discretization level and also for any number of construction layers, the iteration numbers stay roughly constant. The benefits of the nested procedure as well as of the inclusion of second order information are illustrated. Furthermore, the choice of weights for the penalization of overhangs is discussed. For various problem settings, results are presented for one or two materials and void in two as well as in three dimensions.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02206v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02206v1,"math.OC, cs.NA, math.NA, 49J20, 49M41, 65K10, 74P05, 90C48, 90C53"
Can LLMs effectively provide game-theoretic-based scenarios for   cybersecurity?,"Daniele Proverbio, Alessio Buscemi, Alessandro Di Stefano, The Anh Han, German Castignani, Pietro Liò","Game theory has long served as a foundational tool in cybersecurity to test, predict, and design strategic interactions between attackers and defenders. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new tools and challenges for the security of computer systems; In this work, we investigate whether classical game-theoretic frameworks can effectively capture the behaviours of LLM-driven actors and bots. Using a reproducible framework for game-theoretic LLM agents, we investigate two canonical scenarios -- the one-shot zero-sum game and the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma -- and we test whether LLMs converge to expected outcomes or exhibit deviations due to embedded biases. Our experiments involve four state-of-the-art LLMs and span five natural languages, English, French, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Mandarin Chinese, to assess linguistic sensitivity. For both games, we observe that the final payoffs are influenced by agents characteristics such as personality traits or knowledge of repeated rounds. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected sensitivity of the final payoffs to the choice of languages, which should warn against indiscriminate application of LLMs in cybersecurity applications and call for in-depth studies, as LLMs may behave differently when deployed in different countries. We also employ quantitative metrics to evaluate the internal consistency and cross-language stability of LLM agents, to help guide the selection of the most stable LLMs and optimising models for secure applications.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05670v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05670v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.GT"

Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly, leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456 challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical capabilities.

Balancing Information Accuracy and Response Timeliness in Networked LLMs,"Yigit Turkmen, Baturalp Buyukates, Melih Bastopcu","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false) queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$ LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02209v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02209v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.IT, cs.NI, math.IT"
WhiSQA: Non-Intrusive Speech Quality Prediction Using Whisper Encoder   Features,"George Close, Kris Hong, Thomas Hain, Stefan Goetze","There has been significant research effort developing neural-network-based predictors of SQ in recent years. While a primary objective has been to develop non-intrusive, i.e.~reference-free, metrics to assess the performance of SE systems, recent work has also investigated the direct inference of neural SQ predictors within the loss function of downstream speech tasks. To aid in the training of SQ predictors, several large datasets of audio with corresponding human labels of quality have been created. Recent work in this area has shown that speech representations derived from large unsupervised or semi-supervised foundational speech models are useful input feature representations for neural SQ prediction. In this work, a novel and robust SQ predictor is proposed based on feature representations extracted from an ASR model, found to be a powerful input feature for the SQ prediction task. The proposed system achieves higher correlation with human MOS ratings than recent approaches on all NISQA test sets and shows significantly better domain adaption compared to the commonly used DNSMOS metric.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02210v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02210v1,"cs.SD, cs.LG, eess.AS"
Fast Algorithm for Moving Sound Source,Dong Yang,"Modern neural network-based speech processing systems usually need to have reverberation resistance, so the training of such systems requires a large amount of reverberation data. In the process of system training, it is now more inclined to use sampling static systems to simulate dynamic systems, or to supplement data through actually recorded data. However, this cannot fundamentally solve the problem of simulating motion data that conforms to physical laws. Aiming at the core issue of insufficient training data for speech enhancement models in moving scenarios, this paper proposes Yang's motion spatio-temporal sampling reconstruction theory to realize efficient simulation of motion continuous time-varying reverberation. This theory breaks through the limitations of the traditional static Image-Source Method (ISM) in time-varying systems. By decomposing the impulse response of the moving image source into two parts: linear time-invariant modulation and discrete time-varying fractional delay, a moving sound field model conforming to physical laws is established. Based on the band-limited characteristics of motion displacement, a hierarchical sampling strategy is proposed: high sampling rate is used for low-order images to retain details, and low sampling rate is used for high-order images to reduce computational complexity. A fast synthesis architecture is designed to realize real-time simulation. Experiments show that compared with the open-source models, the proposed theory can more accurately restore the amplitude and phase changes in moving scenarios, solving the industry problem of motion sound source data simulation, and providing high-quality dynamic training data for speech enhancement models.",2025-08-04,2025-08-17,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03065v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03065v2,"eess.AS, cs.SD"

With a novel two-stage training process, LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction.

Data Augmentation for Visualization Design Knowledge Bases,"Hyeok Kim, Jeffrey Heer","Visualization knowledge bases enable computational reasoning and recommendation over a visualization design space. These systems evaluate design trade-offs using numeric weights assigned to different features (e.g., binning a variable). Feature weights can be learned automatically by fitting a model to a collection of chart pairs, in which one chart is deemed preferable to the other. To date, labeled chart pairs have been drawn from published empirical research results; however, such pairs are not comprehensive, resulting in a training corpus that lacks many design variants and fails to systematically assess potential trade-offs. To improve knowledge base coverage and accuracy, we contribute data augmentation techniques for generating and labeling chart pairs. We present methods to generate novel chart pairs based on design permutations and by identifying under-assessed features -- leading to an expanded corpus with thousands of new chart pairs, now in need of labels. Accordingly, we next compare varied methods to scale labeling efforts to annotate chart pairs, in order to learn updated feature weights. We evaluate our methods in the context of the Draco knowledge base, demonstrating improvements to both feature coverage and chart recommendation performance.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02216v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02216v1,cs.HC
Multi-Policy Pareto Front Tracking Based Online and Offline   Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning,"Zeyu Zhao, Yueling Che, Kaichen Liu, Jian Li, Junmei Yao","Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking (MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies, whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front. Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front, starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front. Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment interactions and hardware requirements.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02217v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02217v1,cs.LG
Reservoir Computing with Evolved Critical Neural Cellular Automata,"Sidney Pontes-Filho, Stefano Nichele, Mikkel Lepperød","Criticality is a behavioral state in dynamical systems that is known to present the highest computation capabilities, i.e., information transmission, storage, and modification. Therefore, such systems are ideal candidates as a substrate for reservoir computing, a subfield in artificial intelligence. Our choice of a substrate is a cellular automaton (CA) governed by an artificial neural network, also known as neural cellular automaton (NCA). We apply evolution strategy to optimize the NCA to achieve criticality, demonstrated by power law distributions in structures called avalanches. With an evolved critical NCA, the substrate is tested for reservoir computing. Our evaluation of the substrate is performed with two benchmarks, 5-bit memory task and image classification of handwritten digits. The result of the 5-bit memory task achieved a perfect score and the system managed to remember all 5 bits. The result for the image classification task matched and sometimes surpassed the performance of the best elementary CA for this task.

CO-RFT: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language-Action Models through   Chunked Offline Reinforcement Learning,"Dongchi Huang, Zhirui Fang, Tianle Zhang, Yihang Li, Lin Zhao, Chunhe Xia","Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate significant potential for developing generalized policies in real-world robotic control. This progress inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT, an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods, achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02219v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02219v1,"cs.RO, cs.LG"

FinCPRG: A Bidirectional Generation Pipeline for Hierarchical Queries   and Rich Relevance in Financial Chinese Passage Retrieval,"Xuan Xu, Beilin Chu, Qinhong Lin, Yixiao Zhong, Fufang Wen, Jiaqi Liu, Binjie Fei, Yu Li, Zhongliang Yang, Linna Zhou","In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in constructing passage retrieval datasets. However, existing methods still face limitations in expressing cross-doc query needs and controlling annotation quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a bidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical queries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional relevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces two query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from multi-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate structured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from intra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial elements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and prompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance annotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the generation relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method to enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed a Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k Chinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and rich relevance labels. Through evaluations of mined relevance labels, benchmarking and training experiments, we assessed the quality of FinCPRG and validated its effectiveness as a passage retrieval dataset for both training and benchmarking.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02222v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02222v1,"cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.CE"

To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future intelligent wireless networks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02235v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02235v1,"cs.LG, eess.SP"
GSIM: Accelerating RTL Simulation for Large-Scale Designs,"Lu Chen, Dingyi Zhao, Zihao Yu, Ninghui Sun, Yungang Bao","Register Transfer Level (RTL) simulation is widely used in design space exploration, verification, debugging, and preliminary performance evaluation for hardware design.

However, the slow simulation of complex designs has become the bottleneck in design flow. In this work, we explore the sources of computation overhead of RTL simulation and conclude them into four factors. To optimize these factors, we propose several techniques at the supernode level, node level, and bit level. Finally, we implement these techniques in a novel RTL simulator GSIM. GSIM succeeds in simulating XiangShan, the state-of-the-art open-source RISC-V processor. Besides, compared to Verilator, GSIM can achieve speedup of 7.34x for booting Linux on XiangShan, and 19.94x for running CoreMark on Rocket.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02236v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02236v1,cs.AR
An Event-based Fast Intensity Reconstruction Scheme for UAV Real-time   Perception,"Xin Dong, Yiwei Zhang, Yangjie Cui, Jinwu Xiang, Daochun Li, Zhan Tu","Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras. The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm. Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate, typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02238v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02238v1,"cs.CV, cs.RO"
Forecasting When to Forecast: Accelerating Diffusion Models with   Confidence-Gated Taylor,"Xiaoliu Guan, Lielin Jiang, Hanqi Chen, Xu Zhang, Jiaxing Yan, Guanzhong Wang, Yi Liu, Zetao Zhang, Yu Wu","Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion. However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g., attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

Isolating Culture Neurons in Multilingual Large Language Models,"Danial Namazifard, Lukas Galke","Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations, predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting fairness, inclusivity, and alignment.

From Generation to Consumption: Personalized List Value Estimation for   Re-ranking,"Kaike Zhang, Xiaobei Wang, Xiaoyu Yang, Shuchang Liu, Hailan Yang, Xiang Li, Fei Sun, Qi Cao","Re-ranking is critical in recommender systems for optimizing the order of recommendation lists, thus improving user satisfaction and platform revenue. Most existing methods follow a generator-evaluator paradigm, where the evaluator estimates the overall value of each candidate list. However, they often ignore the fact that users may exit before consuming the full list, leading to a mismatch between estimated generation value and actual consumption value. To bridge this gap, we propose CAVE, a personalized Consumption-Aware list Value Estimation framework. CAVE formulates the list value as the expectation over sub-list values, weighted by user-specific exit probabilities at each position. The exit probability is decomposed into an interest-driven component and a stochastic component, the latter modeled via a Weibull distribution to capture random external factors such as fatigue. By jointly modeling sub-list values and user exit behavior, CAVE yields a more faithful estimate of actual list consumption value. We further contribute three large-scale real-world list-wise benchmarks from the Kuaishou platform, varying in size and user activity patterns. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks, two Amazon datasets, and online A/B testing on Kuaishou show that CAVE consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the benefit of explicitly modeling user exits in re-ranking.",2025-08-04,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02242v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02242v2,cs.IR

Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections. This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task. When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%, 5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively.

ByteGen: A Tokenizer-Free Generative Model for Orderbook Events in Byte   Space,"Yang Li, Zhi Chen","Generative modeling of high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics is a critical yet unsolved challenge in quantitative finance, essential for robust market simulation and strategy backtesting. Existing approaches are often constrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern deep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that affect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through discretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen, a novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB events. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte prediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed binary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core novelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and tokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most fundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to discover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules. Our primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework for LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a comprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million events from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized facts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions, heavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that learning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm for modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on standard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization.",2025-08-04,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02247v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02247v2,"q-fin.CP, cs.AI, cs.CE, cs.LG, q-fin.TR"
Data-driven RF Tomography via Cross-modal Sensing and Continual Learning,"Yang Zhao, Tao Wang, Said Elhadi","Data-driven radio frequency (RF) tomography has demonstrated significant potential for underground target detection, due to the penetrative nature of RF signals through soil. However, it is still challenging to achieve accurate and robust performance in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a data-driven radio frequency tomography (DRIFT) framework with the following key components to reconstruct cross section images of underground root tubers, even with significant changes in RF signals. First, we design a cross-modal sensing system with RF and visual sensors, and propose to train an RF tomography deep neural network (DNN) model following the cross-modal learning approach. Then we propose to apply continual learning to automatically update the DNN model, once environment changes are detected in a dynamic environment. Experimental results show that our approach achieves an average equivalent diameter error of 2.29 cm, 23.2% improvement upon the state-of-the-art approach.

A Threshold Phenomenon for the Shortest Lattice Vector Problem in the   Infinity Norm,"Stefan Kuhlmann, Robert Weismantel","One important question in the theory of lattices is to detect a shortest vector: given a norm and a lattice, what is the smallest norm attained by a non-zero vector contained in the lattice? We focus on the infinity norm and work with lattices of the form $A\mathbb{Z}^n$, where $A$ has integer entries and is of full column rank. Finding a shortest vector is NP-hard. We show that this task is fixed parameter tractable in the parameter $\Delta$, the largest absolute value of the determinant of a full rank submatrix of $A$. The algorithm is based on a structural result that can be interpreted as a threshold phenomenon: whenever the dimension $n$ exceeds a certain value determined only by $\Delta$, then a shortest lattice vector attains an infinity norm value of one. This threshold phenomenon has several applications. In particular, it reveals that integer optimal solutions lie on faces of the given polyhedron whose dimensions are bounded only in terms of $\Delta$.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02249v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02249v1,"math.OC, cs.DS, math.CO"
Solving Sudoku Using Oscillatory Neural Networks,"Stefan Porfir, Bram F.

Each cell is represented by an oscillator whose phase encodes a digit, and the synchronization is governed by the Kuramoto model. The system dynamically evolves towards a valid solution by having the puzzle constraints encoded into the weight matrix of the network, and through a proposed novel phase mapping of the Sudoku digits. Experimental results show that ONNs achieve high performance for puzzles with moderate difficulty and outperform Hopfield Neural Networks, particularly in cases with up to 20 initially unknown values. Although the performance decreases with increased ambiguity, ONNs still produce correct solutions in some of the iterations, cases in which the baseline Hopfield Neural Network algorithm fails.

Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Derivative Label Propagation,"Yuanbin Fu, Xiaojie Guo","Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics. Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the solution space.

We refine the connections between nodes using a pseudo-oracle classifier trained on weak (utterance-level) labels, with its influence controlled by an uncertainty measure from Monte Carlo dropout. Additionally, we extend the weakly labelled FluencyBank dataset by incorporating frame-level dysfluency boundaries for four dysfluency types.

These factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases, limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search, enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic scenarios.

Decomposing the Entropy-Performance Exchange: The Missing Keys to   Unlocking Effective Reinforcement Learning,"Jia Deng, Jie Chen, Zhipeng Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen","Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to the baseline methods on various LLMs.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02260v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02260v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Revisit Choice Network for Synthesis and Technology Mapping,"Chen Chen, Jiaqi Yin, Cunxi Yu","Choice network construction is a critical technique for alleviating structural bias issues in Boolean optimization, equivalence checking, and technology mapping. Previous works on lossless synthesis utilize independent optimization to generate multiple snapshots, and use simulation and SAT solvers to identify functionally equivalent nodes. These nodes are then merged into a subject graph with choice nodes. However, such methods often neglect the quality of these choices, raising the question of whether they truly contribute to effective technology mapping.   This paper introduces Cristal, a novel methodology and framework for constructing Boolean choice networks. Specifically, Cristal introduces a new flow of choice network-based synthesis and mapping, including representative logic cone search, structural mutation for generating diverse choice structures via equality saturation, and priority-ranking choice selection along with choice network construction and validation. Through these techniques, Cristal constructs fewer but higher-quality choices.

SplatSSC: Decoupled Depth-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Semantic Scene   Completion,"Rui Qian, Haozhi Cao, Tianchen Deng, Shenghai Yuan, Lihua Xie","Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting process.

These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models.

Semi-Supervised Dual-Threshold Contrastive Learning for Ultrasound Image   Classification and Segmentation,"Peng Zhang, Zhihui Lai, Heng Kong","Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover, segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning, where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative transfer for reducing features discrepancy.

Voronoi Diagram Encoded Hashing,"Yang Xu, Kai Ming Ting","The goal of learning to hash (L2H) is to derive data-dependent hash functions from a given data distribution in order to map data from the input space to a binary coding space.

First, a recent study shows that even using a version of locality sensitive hashing functions without learning achieves binary representations that have comparable accuracy as those of L2H, but with less time cost. Second, existing L2H methods are constrained to three types of hash functions: thresholding, hyperspheres, and hyperplanes only. In this paper, we unveil the potential of Voronoi diagrams in hashing. Voronoi diagram is a suitable candidate because of its three properties. This discovery has led us to propose a simple and efficient no-learning binary hashing method, called Voronoi Diagram Encoded Hashing (VDeH), which constructs a set of hash functions through a data-dependent similarity measure and produces independent binary bits through encoded hashing.

Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3, GPT-oss-120b and GPT-5 can generate high-traffic scenarios while maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical domains.",2025-08-04,2025-08-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02269v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02269v2,cs.AI
Skeleton-Guided Learning for Shortest Path Search,"Tiantian Liu, Xiao Li, Huan Li, Hua Lu, Christian S. Jensen, Jianliang Xu","Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage. Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for learning-based shortest path search.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02270v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02270v1,"cs.LG, cs.DB"

To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this approach and demonstrates its potential.

mCardiacDx: Radar-Driven Contactless Monitoring and Diagnosis of   Arrhythmia,"Arjun Kumar, Noppanat Wadlom, Jaeheon Kwak, Si-Hyuck Kang, Insik Shin","Arrhythmia is a common cardiac condition that can precipitate severe complications without timely intervention. While continuous monitoring is essential for timely diagnosis, conventional approaches such as electrocardiogram and wearable devices are constrained by their reliance on specialized medical expertise and patient discomfort from their contact nature. Existing contactless monitoring, primarily designed for healthy subjects, face significant challenges when analyzing reflected signals from arrhythmia patients due to disrupted spatial stability and temporal consistency.   In this paper, we introduce mCardiacDx, a radar-driven contactless system that accurately analyzes reflected signals and reconstructs heart pulse waveforms for arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis.

Comparing Generative Models with the New Physics Learning Machine,"Samuele Grossi, Marco Letizia, Riccardo Torre","The rise of generative models for scientific research calls for the development of new methods to evaluate their fidelity. A natural framework for addressing this problem is two-sample hypothesis testing, namely the task of determining whether two data sets are drawn from the same distribution. In large-scale and high-dimensional regimes, machine learning offers a set of tools to push beyond the limitations of standard statistical techniques. In this work, we put this claim to the test by comparing a recent proposal from the high-energy physics literature, the New Physics Learning Machine, to perform a classification-based two-sample test against a number of alternative approaches, following the framework presented in Grossi et al.

However, autonomously building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules: Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus. We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction, using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling challenge.

Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy. However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network (SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers: SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy (0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new state-of-the-art.",2025-08-04,2025-08-09,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02278v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02278v2,cs.CV

OnPair: Short Strings Compression for Fast Random Access,"Francesco Gargiulo, Rossano Venturini","We present OnPair, a dictionary-based compression algorithm designed to meet the needs of in-memory database systems that require both high compression and fast random access. Existing methods either achieve strong compression ratios at significant computational and memory cost (e.g., BPE) or prioritize speed at the expense of compression quality (e.g., FSST). OnPair bridges this gap by employing a cache-friendly dictionary construction technique that incrementally merges frequent adjacent substrings in a single sequential pass over a data sample. This enables fast, memory-efficient training without tracking global pair positions, as required by traditional BPE. We also introduce OnPair16, a variant that limits dictionary entries to 16 bytes, enabling faster parsing via optimized longest prefix matching. Both variants compress strings independently, supporting fine-grained random access without block-level overhead.

Do Edges Matter? Investigating Edge-Enhanced Pre-Training for Medical   Image Segmentation,"Paul Zaha, Lars Böcking, Simeon Allmendinger, Leopold Müller, Niklas Kühl","Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance. However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities. In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw data only.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02281v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02281v1,"cs.CV, cs.LG, H.0"
Distillation-Enhanced Clustering Acceleration for Encrypted Traffic   Classification,"Ziyue Huang, Chungang Lin, Weiyao Zhang, Xuying Meng, Yujun Zhang","Traffic classification plays a significant role in network service management. The advancement of deep learning has established pretrained models as a robust approach for this task. However, contemporary encrypted traffic classification systems face dual limitations. Firstly, pretrained models typically exhibit large-scale architectures, where their extensive parameterization results in slow inference speeds and high computational latency. Secondly, reliance on labeled data for fine-tuning restricts these models to predefined supervised classes, creating a bottleneck when novel traffic types emerge in the evolving Internet landscape. To address these challenges, we propose NetClus, a novel framework integrating pretrained models with distillation-enhanced clustering acceleration. During fine-tuning, NetClus first introduces a cluster-friendly loss to jointly reshape the latent space for both classification and clustering. With the fine-tuned model, it distills the model into a lightweight Feed-Forward Neural Network model to retain semantics. During inference, NetClus performs heuristic merge with near-linear runtime, and valid the cluster purity with newly proposed metrics ASI to identify emergent traffic types while expediting classification. Benchmarked against existing pretrained methods, NetClus achieves up to 6.2x acceleration while maintaining classification degradation below 1%.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02282v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02282v1,cs.NI
An Enhanced Focal Loss Function to Mitigate Class Imbalance in Auto   Insurance Fraud Detection with Explainable AI,"Francis Boabang, Samuel Asante Gyamerah","In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution. Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy, precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud detection systems in the insurance industry.

Thermal Implications of Non-Uniform Power in BSPDN-Enabled 2.5D/3D   Chiplet-based Systems-in-Package using Nanosheet Technology,"Yukai Chen, Massimiliano Di Todaro, Bjorn Vermeersch, Herman Oprins, Daniele Jahier Pagliari, Julien Ryckaert, Dwaipayan Biswas, James Myers","Advances in nanosheet technologies have significantly increased power densities, exacerbating thermal management challenges in 2.5D/3D chiplet-based Systems-in-Package (SiP). While traditional thermal analyses often employ uniform power maps to simplify computational complexity, this practice neglects localized heating effects, leading to inaccuracies in thermal estimations, especially when comparing power delivery networks (PDN) in 3D integration. This work examines the thermal impact of non-uniform power distributions on SiPs utilizing frontside (FSPDN) and backside (BSPDN) power delivery approaches. Using high-resolution thermal simulations with non-uniform power maps at resolutions down to 5 micrometers, we demonstrate that uniform power assumptions substantially underestimate peak temperatures and fail to reveal critical thermal differences between BSPDN and FSPDN configurations in 3D scenarios. Our results highlight that BSPDN configurations in 3D, although beneficial in simplified uniform scenarios, exhibit pronounced thermal penalties under realistic, localized workloads due to limited lateral heat spreading. These findings emphasize the necessity of adopting fine-grained, workload-aware power maps in early-stage thermal modeling to enable accurate PDN assessment and informed thermal-aware design decisions in advanced nanosheet-based 3D SiP.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02284v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02284v1,cs.ET

Unleashing the Temporal Potential of Stereo Event Cameras for   Continuous-Time 3D Object Detection,"Jae-Young Kang, Hoonhee Cho, Kuk-Jin Yoon","3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios. Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution, offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both. Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with object-centric information.

Distributed Non-Uniform Scaling Control of Multi-Agent Formation via   Matrix-Valued Constraints,"Tao He, Gangshan Jing","Distributed formation maneuver control refers to the problem of maneuvering a group of agents to change their formation shape by adjusting the motions of partial agents, where the controller of each agent only requires local information measured from its neighbors. Although this problem has been extensively investigated, existing approaches are mostly limited to uniform scaling transformations. This article proposes a new type of local matrix-valued constraints, via which non-uniform scaling control of position formation can be achieved by tuning the positions of only two agents (i.e., leaders). Here, the non-uniform scaling transformation refers to scaling the position formation with different ratios along different orthogonal coordinate directions. Moreover, by defining scaling and translation of attitude formation, we propose a distributed control scheme for scaling and translation maneuver control of joint position-attitude formations. It is proven that the proposed controller achieves global convergence, provided that the sensing graph among agents is a 2-rooted bidirectional graph. Compared with the affine formation maneuver control approach, the proposed approach leverages a sparser sensing graph, requires fewer leaders, and additionally enables scaling transformations of the attitude formation.

Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner: An   Efficient Neural Network Pruning Method,"Chenqing Lin, Mostafa Hussien, Chengyao Yu, Mohamed Cheriet, Osama Abdelrahman, Ruixing Ming","Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error, which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally, FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate. Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG) demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while maintaining high accuracy.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02291v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02291v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"

Towards Real Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Via Confident Meta-Learning,"Muhammad Aqeel, Shakiba Sharifi, Marco Cristani, Francesco Setti","So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal.

We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning, which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data. CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method trainable via gradient descent.

This paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality, though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02294v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02294v1,cs.LG

Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset. FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672, and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate, explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable, high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving real-world wound assessment and patient care.",2025-08-04,2025-08-12,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03758v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03758v2,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
CAPO: Towards Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Verifiable Generative   Credit Assignment,"Guofu Xie, Yunsheng Shi, Hongtao Tian, Ting Yao, Xiao Zhang","Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning (RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02298v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02298v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL"
ASPEN: An Additional Sampling Penalty Method for Finite-Sum Optimization   Problems with Nonlinear Equality Constraints,"Nataša Krejić, Nataša Krklec Jerinkić, Tijana Ostojić, Nemanja Vučićević","We propose a novel algorithm for solving non-convex, nonlinear equality-constrained finite-sum optimization problems. The proposed algorithm incorporates an additional sampling strategy for sample size update into the well-known framework of quadratic penalty methods. Thus, depending on the problem at hand, the resulting method may exhibit a sample size strategy ranging from a mini-batch on one end, to increasing sample size that achieves the full sample eventually, on the other end of the spectrum. A non-monotone line search is used for the step size update, while the penalty parameter is also adaptive. The proposed algorithm avoids costly projections, which, together with the sample size update, may yield significant computational cost savings. Also, the proposed method can be viewed as a transition of an additional sampling approach for unconstrained and linear constrained problems, to a more general class with non-linear constraints. The almost sure convergence is proved under a standard set of assumptions for this framework, while numerical experiments on both academic and real-data based machine learning problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02299v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02299v1,"math.OC, cs.NA, math.NA, 90C15, 90C30, 65K05, 65K10"

Monitoring Hyperproperties over Observed and Constructed Traces,"Marek Chalupa, Thomas A. Henzinger, Ana Oliveira da Costa","We study the problem of monitoring at runtime whether a system fulfills a specification defined by a hyperproperty, such as linearizability or variants of non-interference. For this purpose, we introduce specifications with both passive and active quantification over traces. While passive trace quantifiers range over the traces that are observed, active trace quantifiers are instantiated with \emph{generator functions}, which are part of the specification. Generator functions enable the monitor to construct traces that may never be observed at runtime, such as the linearizations of a concurrent trace. As specification language, we extend hypernode logic with trace quantifiers over generator functions and interpret these hypernode formulas over possibly infinite domains. We present a corresponding monitoring algorithm, which we implemented and evaluated on a range of hyperproperties for concurrency and security applications. Our method enables, for the first time, the monitoring of asynchronous hyperproperties that contain alternating trace quantifiers.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02301v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02301v1,"cs.LO, 68Q60, 68Q45, F.3.1; D.3.1"
ASDR: Exploiting Adaptive Sampling and Data Reuse for CIM-based Instant   Neural Rendering,"Fangxin Liu, Haomin Li, Bowen Zhu, Zongwu Wang, Zhuoran Song, Habing Guan, Li Jiang","Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer significant promise for generating photorealistic images and videos. However, existing mainstream neural rendering models often fall short in meeting the demands for immediacy and power efficiency in practical applications. Specifically, these models frequently exhibit irregular access patterns and substantial computational overhead, leading to undesirable inference latency and high power consumption. Computing-in-memory (CIM), an emerging computational paradigm, has the potential to address these access bottlenecks and reduce the power consumption associated with model execution.   To bridge the gap between model performance and real-world scene requirements, we propose an algorithm-architecture co-design approach, abbreviated as ASDR, a CIM-based accelerator supporting efficient neural rendering. At the algorithmic level, we propose two rendering optimization schemes: (1) Dynamic sampling by online sensing of the rendering difficulty of different pixels, thus reducing access memory and computational overhead. (2) Reducing MLP overhead by decoupling and approximating the volume rendering of color and density. At the architecture level, we design an efficient ReRAM-based CIM architecture with efficient data mapping and reuse microarchitecture. Experiments demonstrate that our design can achieve up to $9.55\times$ and $69.75\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art NeRF accelerators and Xavier NX GPU in graphics rendering tasks with only $0.1$ PSNR loss.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02304v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02304v1,"cs.AR, cs.ET, cs.GR"

Whole-body Representation Learning For Competing Preclinical Disease   Risk Assessment,"Dmitrii Seletkov, Sophie Starck, Ayhan Can Erdur, Yundi Zhang, Daniel Rueckert, Rickmer Braren","Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention. However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools. We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for early personalized risk stratification.

LaMPE: Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding for Adaptive   Long-context Scaling Without Training,"Sikui Zhang, Guangze Gao, Ziyun Gan, Chunfeng Yuan, Zefeng Lin, Houwen Peng, Bing Li, Weiming Hu","Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length extrapolation methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE.",2025-08-04,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02308v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02308v2,cs.CL
PUSHtap: PIM-based In-Memory HTAP with Unified Data Storage Format,"Yilong Zhao, Mingyu Gao, Huanchen Zhang, Fangxin Liu, Gongye Chen, He Xian, Haibing Guan, Li Jiang","Hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) is an emerging database paradigm that supports both online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads. Computing-intensive OLTP operations, involving row-wise data manipulation, are suitable for row-store format. In contrast, memory-intensive OLAP operations, which are column-centric, benefit from column-store format. This \emph{data-format dilemma} prevents HTAP systems from concurrently achieving three design goals: performance isolation, data freshness, and workload-specific optimization. Another background technology is Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computing units (PIM units) inside DRAM memory devices to accelerate memory-intensive workloads, including OLAP.   Our key insight is to combine the interleaved CPU access and localized PIM unit access to provide two-dimensional access to address the data format contradictions inherent in HTAP. First, we propose a unified data storage format with novel data alignment and placement techniques to optimize the effective bandwidth of CPUs and PIM units and exploit the PIM's parallelism. Second, we implement the multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) essential for single-instance HTAP. Third, we extend the commercial PIM architecture to support the OLAP operations and concurrent access from PIM and CPU. Experiments show that PUSHtap can achieve 3.4\texttimes{}/4.4\texttimes{} OLAP/OLTP throughput improvement compared to multi-instance PIM-based design.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02309v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02309v1,cs.DC
A Survey on Data Security in Large Language Models,"Kang Chen, Xiuze Zhou, Yuanguo Lin, Jinhe Su, Yuanhui Yu, Li Shen, Fan Lin","Large Language Models (LLMs), now a foundation in advancing natural language processing, power applications such as text generation, machine translation, and conversational systems.

NMS: Efficient Edge DNN Training via Near-Memory Sampling on Manifolds,"Boran Zhao, Haiduo Huang, Qiwei Dang, Wenzhe Zhao, Tian Xia, Pengju Ren","Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections, leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02313v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02313v1,cs.LG

Is Uncertainty Quantification a Viable Alternative to Learned Deferral?,"Anna M. Wundram, Christian F. Baumgartner","Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift. Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may be a promising choice for AI deferral.",2025-08-04,2025-08-26,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02319v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02319v2,cs.CV
Zero-shot Compositional Action Recognition with Neural Logic Constraints,"Gefan Ye, Lin Li, Kexin Li, Jun Xiao, Long Chen","Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2) Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives, empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic abstraction and existing models.

Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas.

Logistic regression revealed that preference for the exploratory interaction was predicted by enjoyment, usefulness, novelty, and conversational quality. Unexpectedly, perceived effectiveness was also associated with exploratory preference. Clustering uncovered five latent user profiles with distinct dialogue style preferences. Moderation analyses indicated that age, gender, and control preference significantly influenced these choices.

A Compression Based Classification Framework Using Symbolic Dynamics of   Chaotic Maps,"Parth Naik, Harikrishnan N B","We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01', `10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems, symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8469 etc.). Rather than aiming for state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression, which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information processing.",2025-08-04,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02330v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02330v2,cs.LG
Assessing the Impact of Image Super Resolution on White Blood Cell   Classification Accuracy,"Tatwadarshi P. Nagarhalli, Shruti S. Pawar, Soham A. Dahanukar, Uday Aswalekar, Ashwini M. Save, Sanket D. Patil","Accurately classifying white blood cells from microscopic images is essential to identify several illnesses and conditions in medical diagnostics. Many deep learning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify images. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures is quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some picture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being utilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The suggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how picture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study specifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more complex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when image resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may learn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are incorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend the impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification accuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct extensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. This research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms customized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the trade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03759v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03759v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM"
BOOST: Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition   Function Selection Technique,"Joon-Hyun Park, Mujin Cheon, Dong-Yeun Koh","The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset, evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse problem landscapes.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02332v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02332v1,"cs.LG, stat.ML"

Posterior Sampling of Probabilistic Word Embeddings,"Väinö Yrjänäinen, Isac Boström, Måns Magnusson, Johan Jonasson","Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.   We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings. In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood, especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for posterior sampling of word embeddings.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02337v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02337v1,"cs.LG, stat.CO"
Vision Language Model-based Testing of Industrial Autonomous Mobile   Robots,"Jiahui Wu, Chengjie Lu, Aitor Arrieta, Shaukat Ali, Thomas Peyrucain","Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are deployed in diverse environments (e.g., warehouses, retail spaces, and offices), where they work alongside humans. Given that human behavior can be unpredictable and that AMRs may not have been trained to handle all possible unknown and uncertain behaviors, it is important to test AMRs under a wide range of human interactions to ensure their safe behavior. Moreover, testing in real environments with actual AMRs and humans is often costly, impractical, and potentially hazardous (e.g., it could result in human injury). To this end, we propose a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based testing approach (RVSG) for industrial AMRs developed by PAL Robotics in Spain. Based on the functional and safety requirements, RVSG uses the VLM to generate diverse human behaviors that violate these requirements. We evaluated RVSG with several requirements and navigation routes in a simulator using the latest AMR from PAL Robotics. Our results show that, compared with the baseline, RVSG can effectively generate requirement-violating scenarios. Moreover, RVSG-generated scenarios increase variability in robot behavior, thereby helping reveal their uncertain behaviors.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02338v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02338v1,"cs.SE, cs.RO"
Correspondence-Free Fast and Robust Spherical Point Pattern Registration,"Anik Sarker, Alan T. Asbeck","Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical ($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors). Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset. ""Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02339v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02339v1,"cs.CV, cs.RO"
Learning Partially-Decorrelated Common Spaces for Ad-hoc Video Search,"Fan Hu, Zijie Xin, Xirong Li","Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple query such as ""Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors"" can span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces, yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations: feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss. Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02340v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02340v1,"cs.CV, cs.IR, cs.MM"
"Agentic Personalized Fashion Recommendation in the Age of Generative AI:   Challenges, Opportunities, and Evaluation","Yashar Deldjoo, Nima Rafiee, Mahdyar Ravanbakhsh","Fashion recommender systems (FaRS) face distinct challenges due to rapid trend shifts, nuanced user preferences, intricate item-item compatibility, and the complex interplay among consumers, brands, and influencers. Traditional recommendation approaches, largely static and retrieval-focused, struggle to effectively capture these dynamic elements, leading to decreased user satisfaction and elevated return rates. This paper synthesizes both academic and industrial viewpoints to map the distinctive output space and stakeholder ecosystem of modern FaRS, identifying the complex interplay among users, brands, platforms, and influencers, and highlighting the unique data and modeling challenges that arise.   We outline a research agenda for industrial FaRS, centered on five representative scenarios spanning static queries, outfit composition, and multi-turn dialogue, and argue that mixed-modality refinement-the ability to combine image-based references (anchors) with nuanced textual constraints-is a particularly critical task for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose an Agentic Mixed-Modality Refinement (AMMR) pipeline, which fuses multimodal encoders with agentic LLM planners and dynamic retrieval, bridging the gap between expressive user intent and fast-changing fashion inventories. Our work shows that moving beyond static retrieval toward adaptive, generative, and stakeholder-aware systems is essential to satisfy the evolving expectations of fashion consumers and brands.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02342v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02342v1,cs.IR
MicroMix: Efficient Mixed-Precision Quantization with Microscaling   Formats for Large Language Models,"Wenyuan Liu, Haoqian Meng, Yilun Luo, Peng Zhang, Xindian Ma","Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error. Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX 5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models, MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines.

In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art, outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily, shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle.

In this work, we compare deep learning-based methods to an adapted signal processing method to automatically detect cyclic respiratory events and extract the dynamic respiratory rate from microphone recordings during high intensity exercise in Standardbred trotters. Our deep learning models are able to detect exhalation sounds (median F1 score of 0.94) in noisy microphone signals and show promising results on unlabelled signals at lower exercising intensity, where the exhalation sounds are less recognisable. Temporal convolutional networks were better at detecting exhalation events and estimating dynamic respiratory rates (median F1: 0.94, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) $\pm$ Confidence Intervals (CI): 1.44$\pm$1.04 bpm, Limits Of Agreements (LOA): 0.63$\pm$7.06 bpm) than long short-term memory networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE$\pm$CI: 3.11$\pm$1.58 bpm) and signal processing methods (MAE$\pm$CI: 2.36$\pm$1.11 bpm).

Adaptive Lattice-based Motion Planning,"Abhishek Dhar, Sarthak Mishra, Spandan Roy, Daniel Axehill","This paper proposes an adaptive lattice-based motion planning solution to address the problem of generating feasible trajectories for systems, represented by a linearly parameterizable non-linear model operating within a cluttered environment. The system model is considered to have uncertain model parameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update the model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic estimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error reduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives generated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model selected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also equipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal estimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall motion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the size of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive learning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well as in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter and the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of the implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go arbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with the true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion planning performance over time. The efficiency of the motion planner is demonstrated by a suitable simulation example that considers a drone model represented by Euler-Lagrange dynamics containing uncertain parameters and operating within a cluttered environment.",2025-08-04,2025-08-19,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02350v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02350v2,"cs.RO, cs.SY, eess.SY"

Data-Driven Adaptive Second-Order Sliding Mode Control with Noisy Data,"Behrad Samari, Gian Paolo Incremona, Antonella Ferrara, Abolfazl Lavaei","This paper offers a data-driven approach for designing adaptive suboptimal second-order sliding mode (ASSOSM) controllers for single-input nonlinear systems, characterized by perturbed strict-feedback structures with unknown dynamics. The proposed approach is recursive, in which the system dynamics are first decomposed into two parts, referred to as the upper and lower dynamics. The control design task is then divided into two stages, that is, designing a virtual controller for the upper dynamics, followed by synthesizing the actual controller for the full-order system. To this end, we start by collecting noisy data from the system through a finite-time experiment, referred to as a single trajectory. We then formulate a data-dependent condition as a semidefinite program, whose feasibility enables the design of a virtual controller that ensures global asymptotic stability of the origin for the upper dynamics. Building upon this virtual controller, we subsequently propose a data-driven sliding variable that facilitates the design of an ASSOSM controller for the unknown full-order system. This controller guarantees semi-global asymptotic stability of the origin in the presence of disturbances. Specifically, for any prescribed bounded set--no matter how large--the controller's design parameters can be chosen to ensure asymptotic stability of the origin.

Fully implicit timestepping methods for the rotating shallow water   equations,"Werner Bauer, Colin J. Cotter","Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark.

Toward a reliable PWM-based light-emitting diode visual stimulus for   improved SSVEP response with minimal visual fatigue,"Surej Mouli, Ramaswamy Palaniappan","Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints. Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95% generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak response for duty-cycle of 85%.

Understanding and Mitigating Political Stance Cross-topic Generalization   in Large Language Models,"Jiayi Zhang, Shu Yang, Junchao Wu, Derek F. Wong, Di Wang","Fine-tuning Large Language Models on a political topic will significantly manipulate their political stance on various issues and unintentionally affect their stance on unrelated topics. While previous studies have proposed this issue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal representations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended cross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the internal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective and how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning. Firstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons: general political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political topics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on individual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across four models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging these insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method, effectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various models and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the cross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving topic-specific performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that selectively inhibiting only 5% of neurons is sufficient to effectively mitigate the cross-topic stance generalization.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02360v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02360v1,cs.CL

Although audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate lip synchronization.

Transport-Guided Rectified Flow Inversion: Improved Image Editing Using   Optimal Transport Theory,"Marian Lupascu, Mihai-Sorin Stupariu","Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9% improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation across diverse editing scenarios.

A Novel Sliced Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Distance,"Moritz Piening, Robert Beinert","The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however, challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries, strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW. Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance; especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02364v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02364v1,"cs.LG, math.OC"
Language Model Guided Reinforcement Learning in Quantitative Trading,"Adam Darmanin, Vince Vella","Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.   We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines.

"Six Guidelines for Trustworthy, Ethical and Responsible Automation   Design","Matouš Jelínek, Nadine Schlicker, Ewart de Visser","Calibrated trust in automated systems (Lee and See 2004) is critical for their safe and seamless integration into society. Users should only rely on a system recommendation when it is actually correct and reject it when it is factually wrong. One requirement to achieve this goal is an accurate trustworthiness assessment, ensuring that the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness aligns with its actual trustworthiness, allowing users to make informed decisions about the extent to which they can rely on the system (Schlicker et al. 2022). We propose six design guidelines to help designers optimize for accurate trustworthiness assessments, thus fostering ethical and responsible human-automation interactions. The proposed guidelines are derived from existing literature in various fields, such as human-computer interaction, cognitive psychology, automation research, user-experience design, and ethics. We are incorporating key principles from the field of pragmatics, specifically the cultivation of common ground (H. H. Clark 1996) and Gricean communication maxims (Grice 1975). These principles are essential for the design of automated systems because the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness is shaped by both environmental contexts, such as organizational culture or societal norms, and by situational context, including the specific circumstances or scenarios in which the interaction occurs (Hoff and Bashir 2015). Our proposed guidelines provide actionable insights for designers to create automated systems that make relevant trustworthiness cues available. This would ideally foster calibrated trust and more satisfactory, productive, and safe interactions between humans and automated systems. Furthermore, the proposed heuristics might work as a tool for evaluating to what extent existing systems enable users to accurately assess a system's trustworthiness.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02371v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02371v1,"cs.HC, cs.CL"
TRUDI and TITUS: A Multi-Perspective Dataset and A Three-Stage   Recognition System for Transportation Unit Identification,"Emre Gülsoylu, André Kelm, Lennart Bengtson, Matthias Hirsch, Christian Wilms, Tim Rolff, Janick Edinger, Simone Frintrop","Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text, and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions. For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID. Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new approaches.

On Effectiveness of Graph Neural Network Architectures for Network   Digital Twins (NDTs),"Iulisloi Zacarias, Oussama Ben Taarit, Admela Jukan","Future networks, such as 6G, will need to support a vast and diverse range of interconnected devices and applications, each with its own set of requirements. While traditional network management approaches will suffice, an automated solutions are becoming a must. However, network automation frameworks are prone to errors, and often they employ ML-based techniques that require training to learn how the network can be optimized. In this sense, network digital twins are a useful tool that allows for the simulation, testing, and training of AI models without affecting the real-world networks and users. This paper presents an AI-based Network Digital Twin (AI-NDT) that leverages a multi-layered knowledge graph architecture and graph neural networks to predict network metrics that directly affect the quality of experience of users. An evaluation of the four most prominent Graph Neural Networks (GNN) architectures was conducted to assess their effectiveness in developing network digital twins. We trained the digital twin on publicly available measurement data from RIPE Atlas, therefore obtaining results close to what is expected in real-world applications. The results show that among the four architectures evaluated, GraphTransformer presents the best performance. However, other architectures might fit better in scenarios where shorter training time is important, while also delivering acceptable results. The results of this work are indicative of what might become common practice for proactive network management, offering a scalable and accurate solution aligned with the requirements of the next-generation networks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02373v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02373v1,"cs.NI, cs.DC"
Uni-Layout: Integrating Human Feedback in Unified Layout Generation and   Evaluation,"Shuo Lu, Yanyin Chen, Wei Feng, Jiahao Fan, Fengheng Li, Zheng Zhang, Jingjing Lv, Junjie Shen, Ching Law, Jian Liang","Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose \textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation, human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts. Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods.

Analysis of Publicly Accessible Operational Technology and Associated   Risks,"Matthew Rodda, Vasilios Mavroudis","Operational Technology (OT) is an integral component of critical national infrastructure, enabling automation and control in industries such as energy, manufacturing, and transportation. However, OT networks, systems, and devices have been designed and deployed prioritising functionality rather than security. This leads to inherent vulnerabilities in many deployed systems when operational misconfigurations expose them to the internet. This report provides an up-to-date overview of the OT threat landscape exposed to the public internet and studies the affected protocols, vendors, software, and the geographic distribution of systems. Our findings reveal nearly 70,000 exposed OT devices globally, with significant concentrations in North America and Europe. Analysis of prevalent protocols (e.g., ModbusTCP, EtherNet/IP, S7) shows that many devices expose detailed identifying information, including outdated firmware versions with known critical vulnerabilities that remain unpatched for years after disclosure.

"Talking Surveys: How Photorealistic Embodied Conversational Agents Shape   Response Quality, Engagement, and Satisfaction","Matus Krajcovic, Peter Demcak, Eduard Kuric","Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly more realistic and capable of dynamic conversations. In online surveys, anthropomorphic agents could help address issues like careless responding and satisficing, which originate from the lack of personal engagement and perceived accountability. However, there is a lack of understanding of how ECAs in user experience research may affect participant engagement, satisfaction, and the quality of responses. As a proof of concept, we propose an instrument that enables the incorporation of conversations with a virtual avatar into surveys, using on AI-driven video generation, speech recognition, and Large Language Models. In our between-subjects study, 80 participants (UK, stratified random sample of general population) either talked to a voice-based agent with an animated video avatar, or interacted with a chatbot. Across surveys based on two self-reported psychometric tests, 2,265 conversation responses were obtained. Statistical comparison of results indicates that embodied agents can contribute significantly to more informative, detailed responses, as well as higher yet more time-efficient engagement. Furthermore, qualitative analysis provides valuable insights for causes of no significant change to satisfaction, linked to personal preferences, turn-taking delays and Uncanny Valley reactions.

Beyond Manually Designed Pruning Policies with Second-Level Performance   Prediction: A Pruning Framework for LLMs,"Zuxin Ma, Yunhe Cui, Yongbin Qin","Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g., layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to 33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods, outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1 minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52 seconds), achieving over 64 times speedup.

Properties and Decoding of Twisted GRS Codes and Their Extensions,"Yang Li, Martianus Frederic Ezerman, Huimin Lao, San Ling","Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that are not equivalent to generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are called non-GRS MDS codes. Alongside near MDS (NMDS) codes, they are applicable in communication, cryptography, and storage systems. From theoretical perspective, it is particularly intriguing to investigate families of linear codes in which each element can be determined to be either a non-GRS MDS or an NMDS code. Two promising candidates for such families emerge from what is known as twisted GRS (TGRS) construction. These candidates are the $(+)$-TGRS codes and their extended versions, called $(+)$-extended TGRS (ETGRS) codes.   Although many of their properties have been characterized, there are gaps to fill. Which among the codes are non-GRS MDS? Can we improve on their decoding by using their error-correcting pairs or deep holes? In this paper we solve these problems. The answer to the first problem leads us to two classes of non-GRS MDS Hermitian self-dual TGRS codes and a proof that there is no Galois self-dual ETGRS code. Addressing the second problem, we present an explicit decoding algorithm for ETGRS codes that outperforms existing decoding algorithms given some conditions. By considering the duals of TGRS codes which are MDS, we determine the covering radius and a class of deep holes of the recently constructed non-GRS MDS codes due to Han and Zhang.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02382v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02382v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"
Graph Embedding in the Graph Fractional Fourier Transform Domain,"Changjie Sheng, Zhichao Zhang, Wei Yao","Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE) into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02383v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02383v1,"cs.LG, cs.IR"

$ε$-Softmax: Approximating One-Hot Vectors for Mitigating Label   Noise,"Jialiang Wang, Xiong Zhou, Deming Zhai, Junjun Jiang, Xiangyang Ji, Xianming Liu","Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise, particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error $\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and effective learning.

Inference-time Scaling for Diffusion-based Audio Super-resolution,"Yizhu Jin, Zhen Ye, Zeyue Tian, Haohe Liu, Qiuqiang Kong, Yike Guo, Wei Xue","Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks, including audio super-resolution (SR). In many applications like movie post-production and album mastering, substantial computational budgets are available for achieving superior audio quality. However, while existing diffusion approaches typically increase sampling steps to improve quality, the performance remains fundamentally limited by the stochastic nature of the sampling process, leading to high-variance and quality-limited outputs. Here, rather than simply increasing the number of sampling steps, we propose a different paradigm through inference-time scaling for SR, which explores multiple solution trajectories during the sampling process. Different task-specific verifiers are developed, and two search algorithms, including the random search and zero-order search for SR, are introduced. By actively guiding the exploration of the high-dimensional solution space through verifier-algorithm combinations, we enable more robust and higher-quality outputs. Through extensive validation across diverse audio domains (speech, music, sound effects) and frequency ranges, we demonstrate consistent performance gains, achieving improvements of up to 9.70% in aesthetics, 5.88% in speaker similarity, 15.20% in word error rate, and 46.98% in spectral distance for speech SR from 4kHz to 24kHz, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach.

JC-Finder: Detecting Java Clone-based Third-Party Library by Class-level   Tree Analysis,"Lida Zhao, Chaofan Li, Yueming Wu, Lyuye Zhang, Jiahui Wu, Chengwei Liu, Sen Chen, Yutao Hu, Zhengzi Xu, Yi Liu, Jingquan Ge, Jun Sun, Yang Liu","While reusing third-party libraries (TPL) facilitates software development, its chaotic management has brought great threats to software maintenance and the unauthorized use of source code also raises ethical problems such as misconduct on copyrighted code. To identify TPL reuse in projects, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is employed, and two categories of SCA techniques are used based on how TPLs are introduced: clone-based SCA and package-manager-based SCA (PM-based SCA). Although introducing TPLs by clones is prevalent in Java, no clone-based SCA tools are specially designed for Java. Also, directly applying clone-based SCA techniques from other tools is problematic. To fill this gap, we introduce JC-Finder, a novel clone-based SCA tool that aims to accurately and comprehensively identify instances of TPL reuse introduced by source code clones in Java projects. JC-Finder achieves both accuracy and efficiency in identifying TPL reuse from code cloning by capturing features at the class level, maintaining inter-function relationships, and excluding trivial or duplicated elements. To evaluate the efficiency of JC-Finder, we applied it to 9,965 most popular Maven libraries as reference data and tested the TPL reuse of 1,000 GitHub projects. The result shows that JC-Finder achieved an F1-score of 0.818, outperforming the other function-level tool by 0.427. The average time taken for resolving TPL reuse is 14.2 seconds, which is approximately 9 times faster than the other tool. We further applied JC-Finder to 7,947 GitHub projects, revealing TPL reuse by code clones in 789 projects (about 9.89% of all projects) and identifying a total of 2,142 TPLs.

CompressKV: Semantic Retrieval Heads Know What Tokens are Not Important   Before Generation,"Xiaolin Lin, Jingcun Wang, Olga Kondrateva, Yiyu Shi, Bing Li, Grace Li Zhang","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.   To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy.

"SoK: Stablecoins for Digital Transformation -- Design, Metrics, and   Application with Real World Asset Tokenization as a Case Study",Luyao Zhang,"Stablecoins have become a foundational component of the digital asset ecosystem, with their market capitalization exceeding 230 billion USD as of May 2025. As fiat-referenced and programmable assets, stablecoins provide low-latency, globally interoperable infrastructure for payments, decentralized finance, DeFi, and tokenized commerce. Their accelerated adoption has prompted extensive regulatory engagement, exemplified by the European Union's Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation, MiCA, the US Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, GENIUS Act, and Hong Kong's Stablecoins Bill. Despite this momentum, academic research remains fragmented across economics, law, and computer science, lacking a unified framework for design, evaluation, and application. This study addresses that gap through a multi-method research design. First, it synthesizes cross-disciplinary literature to construct a taxonomy of stablecoin systems based on custodial structure, stabilization mechanism, and governance. Second, it develops a performance evaluation framework tailored to diverse stakeholder needs, supported by an open-source benchmarking pipeline to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Third, a case study on Real World Asset tokenization illustrates how stablecoins operate as programmable monetary infrastructure in cross-border digital systems. By integrating conceptual theory with empirical tools, the paper contributes: a unified taxonomy for stablecoin design; a stakeholder-oriented performance evaluation framework; an empirical case linking stablecoins to sectoral transformation; and reproducible methods and datasets to inform future research. These contributions support the development of trusted, inclusive, and transparent digital monetary infrastructure.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02403v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02403v1,"econ.GN, cs.CE, cs.CR, cs.CY, q-fin.CP, q-fin.EC"
Improving Generalization of Language-Conditioned Robot Manipulation,"Chenglin Cui, Chaoran Zhu, Changjae Oh, Andrea Cavallaro","The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper, we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02405v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02405v1,"cs.RO, cs.CV"
Quantum Machine Learning-based Test Oracle for Autonomous Mobile Robots,"Xinyi Wang, Qinghua Xu, Paolo Arcaini, Shaukat Ali, Thomas Peyrucain","Robots are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, interacting with both the environment and humans to perform their tasks. The software of such robots often undergoes upgrades, for example, to add new functionalities, fix bugs, or delete obsolete functionalities. As a result, regression testing of robot software becomes necessary. However, determining the expected correct behavior of robots (i.e., a test oracle) is challenging due to the potentially unknown environments in which the robots must operate. To address this challenge, machine learning (ML)-based test oracles present a viable solution. This paper reports on the development of a test oracle to support regression testing of autonomous mobile robots built by PAL Robotics (Spain), using quantum machine learning (QML), which enables faster training and the construction of more precise test oracles. Specifically, we propose a hybrid framework, QuReBot, that combines both quantum reservoir computing (QRC) and a simple neural network, inspired by residual connection, to predict the expected behavior of a robot. Results show that QRC alone fails to converge in our case, yielding high prediction error. In contrast, QuReBot converges and achieves 15% reduction of prediction error compared to the classical neural network baseline. Finally, we further examine QuReBot under different configurations and offer practical guidance on optimal settings to support future robot software testing.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02407v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02407v1,cs.SE

However, existing methods rely on the average gradient magnitude of points within the view, often leading to severe needle-like artifacts under sparse-view conditions. To address this challenge, we propose GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that suppresses needle-like artifacts and improves reconstruction accuracy under sparse-view conditions. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a Denoised Point Cloud Initialization Strategy that reduces initialization errors and accelerates convergence; and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient Strategy that refines gradient computation using graph-based density differences, improving splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021.

Hydra: Accurate Multi-Modal Leaf Wetness Sensing with mm-Wave and Camera   Fusion,"Yimeng Liu, Maolin Gan, Huaili Zeng, Li Liu, Younsuk Dong, Zhichao Cao","Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images. Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves an accuracy rate of around 90%.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02409v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02409v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
HGTS-Former: Hierarchical HyperGraph Transformer for Multivariate Time   Series Analysis,"Xiao Wang, Hao Si, Fan Zhang, Xiaoya Zhou, Dengdi Sun, Wanli Lyu, Qingquan Yang, Jin Tang","Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables. Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables. After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed HGTS-Former.

Language Models Can Understand Spectra: A Multimodal Model for Molecular   Structure Elucidation,"Yunyue Su, Jiahui Chen, Zao Jiang, Zhenyi Zhong, Liang Wang, Qiang Liu","Structure elucidation is a fundamental technique for understanding the microscopic composition of matter and is widely applied across various disciplines in the natural sciences and engineering. However, existing methods often rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making it difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures typically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This process heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by high costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these challenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to support multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of processing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing end-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to uncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across spectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and fine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six standardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches trained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong robustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its multi-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural prediction.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08441v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08441v1,"q-bio.QM, cs.CE, cs.LG, 68T07, 68Q32, 92E10, I.2.6; I.2.7; I.2.3; J.2; H.2.8"
Improving Knowledge Graph Understanding with Contextual Views --   Extended,"Antrea Christou, Cogan Shimizu","Navigating, visualizing, and discovery in graph data is frequently a difficult prospect. This is especially true for knowledge graphs (KGs), due to high number of possible labeled connections to other data. However, KGs are frequently equipped with an ontology as a schema. That is, it informs how the relationships between data may be constrained. This additional information can be leveraged to improve how (knowledge) graph data can be navigated, visualized, or otherwise utilized in a discovery process. In this manuscript, we introduce the Interactive Knowledge (InK) Browser. This tool specifically takes advantage ontological information (i.e., knowledge) when found in KGs. Specifically, we use modular views that provide various perspectives over the graph, including an interactive schema view, data listings based on type, neighborhood connections, and geospatial depiction (where appropriate). For this manuscript, we have evaluated the basic premise of this tool over a user group ($n= With this grown user survey, we continue to evaluate how scalable tools, including flexible views, can make KG exploration easier for a range of applications.)",2025-08-04,2025-08-11,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02413v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02413v2,cs.HC
ASMR: Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client Resilience in Federated   Learning,"Mirko Konstantin, Moritz Fuchs, Anirban Mukhopadhyay","Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02414v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02414v1,cs.LG

To investigate this, we reviewed 101 studies, focusing on the widely used DEAP dataset for emotion recognition. Our analysis revealed widespread methodological issues that include data leakage from improper segmentation, biased feature selection, flawed hyperparameter optimization, neglect of class imbalance, and insufficient methodological reporting. Notably, we found that nearly 87% of the reviewed papers contained one or more of these errors. Moreover, through experimental analysis, we observed that such methodological flaws can inflate the classification accuracy by up to 46%.

Modality Bias in LVLMs: Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination   via Attention Lens,"Haohan Zheng, Zhenguo Zhang","Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs, generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens, balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions. Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting its generalizability and efficacy.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02419v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02419v1,"cs.CV, cs.CL"
Emergence of Fair Leaders via Mediators in Multi-Agent Reinforcement   Learning,"Akshay Dodwadmath, Setareh Maghsudi","Stackelberg games and their resulting equilibria have received increasing attention in the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature. Each stage of a traditional Stackelberg game involves a leader(s) acting first, followed by the followers. In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be interchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for example, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who should be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead to unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are self-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define this leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents' returns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that maximizes fairness by integrating mediators. Mediators have previously been used in the simultaneous action setting with varying levels of control, such as directly performing agents' actions or just recommending them. Our framework integrates mediators in the Stackelberg setting with minimal control (leader selection). We show that the presence of mediators leads to self-interested agents taking fair actions, resulting in higher overall fairness in agents' returns.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02421v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02421v1,"cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.LG"
Superior resilience to poisoning and amenability to unlearning in   quantum machine learning,"Yu-Qin Chen, Shi-Xin Zhang","The reliability of artificial intelligence hinges on the integrity of its training data, a foundation often compromised by noise and corruption. Here, through a comparative study of classical and quantum neural networks on both classical and quantum data, we reveal a fundamental difference in their response to data corruption. We find that classical models exhibit brittle memorization, leading to a failure in generalization. In contrast, quantum models demonstrate remarkable resilience, which is underscored by a phase transition-like response to increasing label noise, revealing a critical point beyond which the model's performance changes qualitatively. We further establish and investigate the field of quantum machine unlearning, the process of efficiently forcing a trained model to forget corrupting influences. We show that the brittle nature of the classical model forms rigid, stubborn memories of erroneous data, making efficient unlearning challenging, while the quantum model is significantly more amenable to efficient forgetting with approximate unlearning methods. Our findings establish that quantum machine learning can possess a dual advantage of intrinsic resilience and efficient adaptability, providing a promising paradigm for the trustworthy and robust artificial intelligence of the future.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02422v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02422v1,"quant-ph, cs.LG"

Robots must analyze interactions with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified. Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis. Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets. The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models.

Learning to Evolve: Bayesian-Guided Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Linyu Li, Zhi Jin, Yuanpeng He, Dongming Jin, Yichi Zhang, Haoran Duan, Nyima Tash","Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios, traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs. Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the model is prone to ""catastrophic forgetting"", resulting in the loss of previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem, we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly, we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02426v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02426v1,"cs.CL, cs.LG"

This paper introduces FlashCommunication V2, a novel communication paradigm enabling efficient cross-GPU transmission at arbitrary bit widths. Its core innovations lie in the proposed bit splitting and spike reserving techniques, which address the challenges of low-bit quantization. Bit splitting decomposes irregular bit widths into basic units, ensuring compatibility with hardware capabilities and thus enabling transmission at any bit width. Spike reserving, on the other hand, retains numerical outliers (i.e., minima and maxima) as floating-point numbers, which shrinks the dynamic numerical range and pushes the quantization limits to 2-bit with acceptable losses. FlashCommunication V2 significantly enhances the flexibility and resource utilization of communication systems. Through meticulous software-hardware co-design, it delivers robust performance and reduced overhead across both NVLink-based and PCIe-based architectures, achieving a maximum 3.2$\times$ speedup in AllReduce and 2$\times$ in All2All communication.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03760v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03760v1,"cs.DC, cs.AI"

AI-Based Measurement of Innovation: Mapping Expert Insight into Large   Language Model Applications,"Robin Nowak, Patrick Figge, Carolin Haeussler","Measuring innovation often relies on context-specific proxies and on expert evaluation. Hence, empirical innovation research is often limited to settings where such data is available. We investigate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome the constraints of manual expert evaluations and assist researchers in measuring innovation. We design an LLM framework that reliably approximates domain experts' assessment of innovation from unstructured text data. We demonstrate the performance and broad applicability of this framework through two studies in different contexts: (1) the innovativeness of software application updates and (2) the originality of user-generated feedback and improvement ideas in product reviews. We compared the performance (F1-score) and reliability (consistency rate) of our LLM framework against alternative measures used in prior innovation studies, and to state-of-the-art machine learning- and deep learning-based models. The LLM framework achieved higher F1-scores than the other approaches, and its results are highly consistent (i.e., results do not change across runs). This article equips R&D personnel in firms, as well as researchers, reviewers, and editors, with the knowledge and tools to effectively use LLMs for measuring innovation and evaluating the performance of LLM-based innovation measures.

Identifying actionable driver mutations in lung cancer using an   efficient Asymmetric Transformer Decoder,"Biagio Brattoli, Jack Shi, Jongchan Park, Taebum Lee, Donggeun Yoo, Sergio Pereira","Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes. Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations, limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks, proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting biological relevance.

Specifically, a bijective mapping is obtained between i) a commuting local frame of symmetry generators, and ii) a set of Koopman eigenfunctions whose gradients form a local frame. This equivalence is used to convert the problem of finding Koopman eigenfunctions into the equivalent problem of finding commuting vector fields, which are readily given by the flow map of the system. The implication for stability is also studied in terms of a contraction metric that is associated with the commuting local frame of symmetries. The theoretical result is verified with the van der Pol oscillator whose eigenfunctions are computed to the precision of finite numerical integration.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02437v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02437v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math-ph, math.MP"
SoftPUF: a Software-Based Blockchain Framework using PUF and Machine   Learning,"S M Mostaq Hossain, Sheikh Ghafoor, Kumar Yelamarthi, Venkata Prasanth Yanambaka","Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) offers a secure and lightweight alternative to traditional cryptography for authentication due to their unique device fingerprint. However, their dependence on specialized hardware hinders their adoption in diverse applications. This paper proposes a novel blockchain framework that leverages SoftPUF, a software-based approach mimicking PUF. SoftPUF addresses the hardware limitations of traditional PUF, enabling secure and efficient authentication for a broader range of devices within a blockchain network. The framework utilizes a machine learning model trained on PUF data to generate unique, software-based keys for each device. These keys serve as secure identifiers for authentication on the blockchain, eliminating the need for dedicated hardware. This approach facilitates the integration of legacy devices from various domains, including cloud-based solutions, into the blockchain network. Additionally, the framework incorporates well-established defense mechanisms to ensure robust security against various attacks. This combined approach paves the way for secure and scalable authentication in diverse blockchain-based applications.

Glioblastoma Overall Survival Prediction With Vision Transformers,"Yin Lin, Riccardo Barbieri, Domenico Aquino, Giuseppe Lauria, Marina Grisoli, Elena De Momi, Alberto Redaelli, Simona Ferrante","Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images, exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational resource requirements.   The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods. Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on segmentation.",2025-08-04,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02439v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02439v2,cs.CV

Computationally efficient Gauss-Newton reinforcement learning for model   predictive control,"Dean Brandner, Sebastien Gros, Sergio Lucia","Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used in process control due to its interpretability and ability to handle constraints. As a parametric policy in reinforcement learning (RL), MPC offers strong initial performance and low data requirements compared to black-box policies like neural networks. However, most RL methods rely on first-order updates, which scale well to large parameter spaces but converge at most linearly, making them inefficient when each policy update requires solving an optimal control problem, as is the case with MPC. While MPC policies are typically sparsely parameterized and thus amenable to second-order approaches, existing second-order methods demand second-order policy derivatives, which can be computationally and memory-wise intractable.   This work introduces a Gauss-Newton approximation of the deterministic policy Hessian that eliminates the need for second-order policy derivatives, enabling superlinear convergence with minimal computational overhead. To further improve robustness, we propose a momentum-based Hessian averaging scheme for stable training under noisy estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a nonlinear continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), showing faster convergence and improved data efficiency over state-of-the-art first-order methods.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02441v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02441v1,"eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.SY"
Assessing the Reliability and Validity of Large Language Models for   Automated Assessment of Student Essays in Higher Education,"Andrea Gaggioli, Giuseppe Casaburi, Leonardo Ercolani, Francesco Collova', Pietro Torre, Fabrizio Davide","This study investigates the reliability and validity of five advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), Claude 3.5, DeepSeek v2, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4, and Mistral 24B, for automated essay scoring in a real world higher education context. A total of 67 Italian-language student essays, written as part of a university psychology course, were evaluated using a four-criterion rubric (Pertinence, Coherence, Originality, Feasibility). Each model scored all essays across three prompt replications to assess intra-model stability. Human-LLM agreement was consistently low and non-significant (Quadratic Weighted Kappa), and within-model reliability across replications was similarly weak (median Kendall's W < 0.30). Systematic scoring divergences emerged, including a tendency to inflate Coherence and inconsistent handling of context-dependent dimensions. Inter-model agreement analysis revealed moderate convergence for Coherence and Originality, but negligible concordance for Pertinence and Feasibility. Although limited in scope, these findings suggest that current LLMs may struggle to replicate human judgment in tasks requiring disciplinary insight and contextual sensitivity.

Uncertainty Estimation for Novel Views in Gaussian Splatting from   Primitive-Based Representations of Error and Visibility,"Thomas Gottwald, Edgar Heinert, Matthias Rottmann","In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method, investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes, allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02443v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02443v1,"cs.GR, cs.CV"
Self-Organizing Survival Manifolds: A Theory for Unsupervised Discovery   of Prognostic Structures in Biological Systems,Atahan Karagoz,"Survival is traditionally modeled as a supervised learning task, reliant on curated outcome labels and fixed covariates. This work rejects that premise. It proposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric consequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in biological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival Manifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature geodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A survival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is introduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric flow stability. We derive discrete and continuous formulations of the objective and prove theoretical results demonstrating the emergence and convergence of survival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions. The framework draws connections to thermodynamic efficiency, entropy flow, Ricci curvature, and optimal transport, grounding survival modeling in physical law. Health, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions in the manifold's structure. This theory offers a universal, label-free foundation for modeling survival as a property of form, not annotation-bridging machine learning, biophysics, and the geometry of life itself.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06539v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06539v1,"cs.LG, math.OC"
"TeraNoC: A Multi-Channel 32-bit Fine-Grained, Hybrid Mesh-Crossbar NoC   for Efficient Scale-up of 1000+ Core Shared-L1-Memory Clusters","Yichao Zhang, Zexin Fu, Tim Fischer, Yinrong Li, Marco Bertuletti, Luca Benini","A key challenge in on-chip interconnect design is to scale up bandwidth while maintaining low latency and high area efficiency. 2D-meshes scale with low wiring area and congestion overhead; however, their end-to-end latency increases with the number of hops, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive core-to-L1-memory access. On the other hand, crossbars offer low latency, but their routing complexity grows quadratically with the number of I/Os, requiring large physical routing resources and limiting area-efficient scalability. This two-sided interconnect bottleneck hinders the scale-up of many-core, low-latency, tightly coupled shared-memory clusters, pushing designers toward instantiating many smaller and loosely coupled clusters, at the cost of hardware and software overheads. We present TeraNoC, an open-source, hybrid mesh-crossbar on-chip interconnect that offers both scalability and low latency, while maintaining very low routing overhead. The topology, built on 32bit word-width multi-channel 2D-meshes and crossbars, enables the area-efficient scale-up of shared-memory clusters. A router remapper is designed to balance traffic load across interconnect channels. Using TeraNoC, we build a cluster with 1024 single-stage, single-issue cores that share a 4096-banked L1 memory, implemented in 12nm technology. The low interconnect stalls enable high compute utilization of up to 0.85 IPC in compute-intensive, data-parallel key GenAI kernels. TeraNoC only consumes 7.6\% of the total cluster power in kernels dominated by crossbar accesses, and 22.7\% in kernels with high 2D-mesh traffic. Compared to a hierarchical crossbar-only cluster, TeraNoC reduces die area by 37.8\% and improves area efficiency (GFLOP/s/mm2) by up to 98.7\%, while occupying only 10.9\% of the logic area.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02446v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02446v1,cs.DC
Charting 15 years of progress in deep learning for speech emotion   recognition: A replication study,"Andreas Triantafyllopoulos, Anton Batliner, Björn W. Schuller","Speech emotion recognition (SER) has long benefited from the adoption of deep learning methodologies. Deeper models -- with more layers and more trainable parameters -- are generally perceived as being `better' by the SER community. This raises the question -- \emph{how much better} are modern-era deep neural networks compared to their earlier iterations? Beyond that, the more important question of how to move forward remains as poignant as ever. SER is far from a solved problem; therefore, identifying the most prominent avenues of future research is of paramount importance. In the present contribution, we attempt a quantification of progress in the 15 years of research beginning with the introduction of the landmark 2009 INTERSPEECH Emotion Challenge. We conduct a large scale investigation of model architectures, spanning both audio-based models that rely on speech inputs and text-baed models that rely solely on transcriptions. Our results point towards diminishing returns and a plateau after the recent introduction of transformer architectures. Moreover, we demonstrate how perceptions of progress are conditioned on the particular selection of models that are compared.

"XFacta: Contemporary, Real-World Dataset and Evaluation for Multimodal   Misinformation Detection with Multimodal LLMs","Yuzhuo Xiao, Zeyu Han, Yuhan Wang, Huaizu Jiang","The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events, or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new content to maintain its contemporary relevance.

Assuming the form of a double perturbed saddle-point problem, the unique solvability of the continuous formulation is proved using Fredholm's theory for compact operators and the Babuska--Brezzi approach for saddle-point problems with penalty. We propose a stable virtual element method, establishing a discrete inf-sup condition under a small mesh assumption through a Fortin interpolant that requires only $H^1$-regularity for the Stokes problem. We show the well-posedness of the monolithic discrete formulation and introduce an equivalent fixed-point approach employed at the implementation level. The optimal convergence of the method in the energy norm is proved theoretically and is also confirmed numerically via computational experiments.

Dynamic Forgetting and Spatio-Temporal Periodic Interest Modeling for   Local-Life Service Recommendation,"Zhaoyu Hu, Hao Guo, Yuan Tian, Erpeng Xue, Jianyang Wang, Xianyang Qi, Hongxiang Lin, Lei Wang, Sheng Chen","In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM) with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve, which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by modeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics of users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online A/B tests and achieved a 1.54\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV). In addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has been deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system, serving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application scenarios.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02451v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02451v1,"cs.IR, cs.AI"

Beginning with a set of seed prompts, our method embeds them in a continuous latent space and systematically explores this space to identify prompts that maximize task-specific performance. In a proof-of-concept study on the Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification benchmark, LatentPrompt increased classification accuracy by approximately 3 percent after a single optimization cycle.

Thwart Me If You Can: An Empirical Analysis of Android Platform Armoring   Against Stalkerware,"Malvika Jadhav, Wenxuan Bao, Vincent Bindschaedler","Stalkerware is a serious threat to individuals' privacy that is receiving increased attention from the security and privacy research communities. Existing works have largely focused on studying leading stalkerware apps, dual-purpose apps, monetization of stalkerware, or the experience of survivors. However, there remains a need to understand potential defenses beyond the detection-and-removal approach, which may not necessarily be effective in the context of stalkerware.   In this paper, we perform a systematic analysis of a large corpus of recent Android stalkerware apps. We combine multiple analysis techniques to quantify stalkerware behaviors and capabilities and how these evolved over time. Our primary goal is understanding: how (and whether) recent Android platform changes -- largely designed to improve user privacy -- have thwarted stalkerware functionality; how stalkerware may have adapted as a result; and what we may conclude about potential defenses.

TreeRanker: Fast and Model-agnostic Ranking System for Code Suggestions   in IDEs,"Daniele Cipollone, Egor Bogomolov, Arie van Deursen, Maliheh Izadi","Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles. In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible with already deployed models for code completion.

"Comparative Model Fidelity Evaluation to Support Design Decisions for   Complex, Novel Systems of Systems","Edward Louis, Gregory Mocko, Evan Taylor","Systems design processes are increasingly reliant on simulation models to inform design decisions. A pervasive issue within the systems engineering community is trusting in the models used to make decisions about complex systems. This work presents a method of evaluating the trustworthiness of a model to provide utility to a designer making a decision within a design process. Trusting the results of a model is especially important in design processes where the system is complex, novel, or displays emergent phenomena. Additionally, systems that are in the pre-prototype stages of development often do not have sources of ground truth for validating the models. Developing methods of model validation and trust that do not require real-world data is a key challenge facing systems engineers. Model fidelity in this work refers to the adherence of a model to real-world physics and is closely tied to model trust and model validity. Trust and validity directly support a designer's ability to make decisions using physics-based models. The physics that are captured in a model and the complexity of the mathematical representation of the physics contribute to a model's fidelity, and this work leverages the included physical phenomena to develop a means of selecting the most appropriate for a given design decision.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02456v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02456v1,cs.CE
From Stimuli to Minds: Enhancing Psychological Reasoning in LLMs via   Bilateral Reinforcement Learning,"Feng Yichao, Haoran Luo, Lang Feng, Shuai Zhao, Anh Tuan Luu","Large Language Models show promise in emotion understanding, social reasoning, and empathy, yet they struggle with psychologically grounded tasks that require inferring implicit mental states in context-rich, ambiguous settings. These limitations arise from the absence of theory-aligned supervision and the difficulty of capturing nuanced mental processes in real-world narratives. To address this gap, we leverage expert-labeled, psychologically rich scenarios and propose a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework that explicitly imitates expert psychological thought patterns. By integrating real-world stimuli with structured reasoning guidance, our approach enables compact models to internalize social-cognitive principles, perform nuanced psychological inference, and support continual self-improvement. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks further demonstrate that our models achieve expert-level interpretive capabilities, exhibiting strong out-of-distribution generalization and robust continual learning across diverse, challenging, and psychologically grounded tasks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02458v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02458v2,cs.DB

Experimental Evaluation of Post-Quantum Homomorphic Encryption for   Privacy-Preserving V2X Communication,"Abdullah Al Mamun, Kyle Yates, Antsa Rakotondrafara, Mashrur Chowdhury, Ryann Cartor, Shuhong Gao","Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) fundamentally rely on vehicle-generated data for applications such as congestion monitoring and route optimization, making the preservation of user privacy a critical challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) offers a promising solution by enabling computation on encrypted data without revealing underlying content. This study presents the first real-world experimental evaluation of three post-quantum secure HE schemes, i.e., Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV), Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV), and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS), for vehicular communication scenarios. Two representative privacy-preserving use cases are considered: encrypted vehicle counting and average speed aggregation. Experiments are conducted over both Wi-Fi and Ethernet to assess performance under wireless and wired vehicle-to-everything (V2X) settings. Results show that BFV and BGV are suitable for latency-tolerant applications such as intersection monitoring and regional traffic analysis, with total end-to-end latencies under 10 seconds. While CKKS experiences higher overhead, it remains viable for periodic encrypted aggregation of numerical data. The experimental results demonstrate that HE can be feasibly deployed in ITS environments under 128-bit post-quantum security, provided that scheme-specific latency constraints are considered. This reinforces its potential to serve as a foundational tool for secure and privacy-preserving V2X data processing.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02461v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02461v1,cs.CR
SAMPO: Visual Preference Optimization for Intent-Aware Segmentation with   Vision Foundation Models,"Yonghuang Wu, Wenwen Zeng, Xuan Xie, Chengqian Zhao, Guoqing Wu, Jinhua Yu","Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO (Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning. Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9 percentage points compared to the best baseline.

An Efficient and Adaptive Next Edit Suggestion Framework with Zero Human   Instructions in IDEs,"Xinfang Chen, Siyang Xiao, Xianying Zhu, Junhong Xie, Ming Liang, Dajun Chen, Wei Jiang, Yong Li, Peng Di","Code editing, including modifying, refactoring, and maintaining existing code, is the most frequent task in software development and has garnered significant attention from AI-powered tools. However, existing solutions that translate explicit natural language instructions into code edits face critical limitations, such as heavy reliance on human instruction input and high latency, which hinder their effective integration into a developer's workflow. We observe that developers' habitual behaviors and coding objectives are often reflected in their historical editing patterns, making this data key to addressing existing limitations. To leverage these insights, we propose NES (Next Edit Suggestion), an LLM-driven code editing framework that delivers an instruction-free and low-latency experience. Built on a dual-model architecture and trained with our high-quality SFT and DAPO datasets, NES enhances productivity by understanding developer intent while optimizing inference to minimize latency. NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution with a continuous Tab key interaction workflow, seamlessly adopted by a FinTech company with over 20,000 developers. Evaluations on real-world datasets show NES achieves 75.6% and 81.6% accuracy in two tasks of predicting next edit locations, alongside 91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models. Our open-sourced SFT and DAPO datasets have been demonstrated to enhance the performance of open-source CodeLLMs. The demonstration of NES is available at https://youtu.be/yGoyYOe6fbY.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02473v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02473v1,"cs.SE, cs.LG, 68N30, D.2.3; D.1.2; I.2.2"
PoseGuard: Pose-Guided Generation with Safety Guardrails,"Kongxin Wang, Jie Zhang, Peigui Qi, Kunsheng Tang, Tianwei Zhang, Wenbo Zhou","Pose-guided video generation has become a powerful tool in creative industries, exemplified by frameworks like Animate Anyone. However, conditioning generation on specific poses introduces serious risks, such as impersonation, privacy violations, and NSFW content creation. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{PoseGuard}$, a safety alignment framework for pose-guided generation. PoseGuard is designed to suppress unsafe generations by degrading output quality when encountering malicious poses, while maintaining high-fidelity outputs for benign inputs. We categorize unsafe poses into three representative types: discriminatory gestures such as kneeling or offensive salutes, sexually suggestive poses that lead to NSFW content, and poses imitating copyrighted celebrity movements. PoseGuard employs a dual-objective training strategy combining generation fidelity with safety alignment, and uses LoRA-based fine-tuning for efficient, parameter-light updates. To ensure adaptability to evolving threats, PoseGuard supports pose-specific LoRA fusion, enabling flexible and modular updates when new unsafe poses are identified. We further demonstrate the generalizability of PoseGuard to facial landmark-guided generation. Extensive experiments validate that PoseGuard effectively blocks unsafe generations, maintains generation quality for benign inputs, and remains robust against slight pose variations.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02476v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02476v1,cs.CR
Multi-class Image Anomaly Detection for Practical Applications:   Requirements and Robust Solutions,"Jaehyuk Heo, Pilsung Kang","Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks, aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly, previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap. However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios, determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world multi-class anomaly detection tasks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02477v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02477v1,cs.CV
Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory Network for Multi-modal Manipulation   Detecting and Grounding,"Xinquan Yu, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo","The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$) is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision, we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to state-of-the-art methods.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02479v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02479v1,cs.CV
MindShot: Multi-Shot Video Reconstruction from fMRI with LLM Decoding,"Wenwen Zeng, Yonghuang Wu, Yifan Chen, Xuan Xie, Chengqian Zhao, Feiyu Yin, Guoqing Wu, Jinhua Yu","Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments. (2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02480v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02480v1,cs.CV
Toward Using Machine Learning as a Shape Quality Metric for Liver Point   Cloud Generation,"Khoa Tuan Nguyen, Gaeun Oh, Ho-min Park, Francesca Tozzi, Wouter Willaert, Joris Vankerschaver, Niki Rashidian, Wesley De Neve","While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert review.   In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML) methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.   Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight, task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape modeling.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02482v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02482v1,cs.LG
Federated Graph Unlearning,"Yuming Ai, Xunkai Li, Jiaqi Chao, Bowen Fan, Zhengyu Wu, Yinlin Zhu, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang","The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training. However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning, it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process, which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods. Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness of other established methods.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02485v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02485v1,cs.LG
Commit Stability as a Signal for Risk in Open-Source Projects,"Elijah Kayode Adejumo, Brittany Johnson, Mariam Guizani","Open source software (OSS) generates trillions of dollars in economic value and has become essential to technical infrastructures worldwide. As organizations increasingly depend on OSS, understanding project evolution is critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one dimension remains understudied: project resilience -- the ability to return to normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures, security vulnerabilities, and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit patterns reflect underlying project characteristics such as mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust development processes that enable resilience. Building on the Composite Stability Index (CSI) framework, we empirically validate commit frequency patterns across 100 highly ranked repositories. Our findings reveal that only 2\% of repositories exhibit daily stability, 29\% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly stability, while half remain unstable across all temporal levels. Programming languages and blockchain applications were the most stable. We identified two exemplary repositories that achieved stability at all three granularities, whose governance models, CI cadence, and release policies could serve as reference frameworks. We observed that large yearly commit throughput does not necessarily correlate with stability. Beyond commits, stability can be enriched with issue-resolution times, PR merge rates, and community-engagement metrics to broaden resilience assessment and sharpen stability-based risk evaluation.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02487v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02487v1,cs.SE
PHM-Bench: A Domain-Specific Benchmarking Framework for Systematic   Evaluation of Large Models in Prognostics and Health Management,"Puyu Yang, Laifa Tao, Zijian Huang, Haifei Liu, Wenyan Cao, Hao Ji, Jianan Qiu, Qixuan Huang, Xuanyuan Su, Yuhang Xie, Jun Zhang, Shangyu Li, Chen Lu, Zhixuan Lian","With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles, and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks, including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks. PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02490v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02490v1,cs.AI
Low-Frequency First: Eliminating Floating Artifacts in 3D Gaussian   Splatting,"Jianchao Wang, Peng Zhou, Cen Li, Rong Quan, Jie Qin","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS), which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion, effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of 1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks.

Uncertainty-Aware Perception-Based Control for Autonomous Racing,"Jelena Trisovic, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger","Autonomous systems operating in unknown environments often rely heavily on visual sensor data, yet making safe and informed control decisions based on these measurements remains a significant challenge. To facilitate the integration of perception and control in autonomous vehicles, we propose a novel perception-based control approach that incorporates road estimation, quantification of its uncertainty, and uncertainty-aware control based on this estimate. At the core of our method is a parametric road curvature model, optimized using visual measurements of the road through a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. This process ensures adherence to constraints on both model parameters and curvature. By leveraging the Frenet frame formulation, we embed the estimated track curvature into the system dynamics, allowing the controller to explicitly account for perception uncertainty and enhancing robustness to estimation errors based on visual input. We validate our approach in a simulated environment, using a high-fidelity 3D rendering engine, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving reliable and uncertainty-aware control for autonomous racing.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02494v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02494v1,"eess.SY, cs.RO, cs.SY"
Clinical Expert Uncertainty Guided Generalized Label Smoothing for   Medical Noisy Label Learning,"Kunyu Zhang, Lin Gu, Liangchen Liu, Yingke Chen, Binyang Wang, Jin Yan, Yingying Zhu","Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However, these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or ``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.",2025-08-04,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02495v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02495v2,"cs.LG, cs.CV"
Bridging Language Gaps in Open-Source Documentation with   Large-Language-Model Translation,"Elijah Kayode Adejumo, Brittany Johnson, Mariam Guizani","While open source communities attract diverse contributors globally, few repositories provide essential documentation in languages other than English. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in software engineering tasks and translations across domains. However, little is known about LLM capabilities in translating open-source technical documentation, which mixes natural language, code, URLs, and markdown formatting. To understand the need and potential for LLMs in technical documentation translation, we evaluated community translation activity and English-to-German translations of 50 README files using OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 and Anthropic's Claude. We found scarce translation activity, mostly in larger repositories and community-driven in nature. LLM performance comparison suggests they can provide accurate translations. However, analysis revealed fidelity challenges: both models struggled to preserve structural components (e.g., hyperlinks) and exhibited formatting inconsistencies. These findings highlight both promise and challenges of LLM-assisted documentation internationalization. As a first step toward translation-aware continuous integration pipelines, we introduce TRIFID, an early-stage translation fidelity scoring framework that automatically checks how well translations preserve code, links, and formatting.

Monsoon Uprising in Bangladesh: How Facebook Shaped Collective Identity,"Md Tasin Abir, Arpita Chowdhury, Ashfia Rahman","This study investigates how Facebook shaped collective identity during the July 2024 pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh, known as the Monsoon Uprising. During government repression, protesters turned to Facebook as a central space for resistance, where multimodal expressions, images, memes, videos, hashtags, and satirical posts played an important role in unifying participants. Using a qualitative approach, this research analyzes visual rhetoric, verbal discourse, and digital irony to reveal how shared symbols, protest art, and slogans built a sense of solidarity. Key elements included the symbolic use of red, the ironic metaphorical use of the term ""Razakar"", and the widespread sharing of visuals representing courage, injustice, and resistance. The findings show that the combination of visual and verbal strategies on Facebook not only mobilized public sentiment, but also built a strong collective identity that challenged authoritarian narratives. This study tries to demonstrate how online platforms can serve as powerful tools for identity construction and political mobilization in the digital age.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02498v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02498v1,cs.CL

We investigate whether and how LLMs exhibit human-like psycholinguistic responses under different linguistic identities using two tasks: sound symbolism and word valence. We evaluate two models, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, under monolingual and bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese. Behaviorally, both models adjust their outputs based on prompted language identity, with Qwen showing greater sensitivity and sharper distinctions between Dutch and Chinese. Probing analysis reveals that psycholinguistic signals become more decodable in deeper layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger and more stable valence representations than Dutch. Our results demonstrate that language identity conditions both output behavior and internal representations in LLMs, providing new insights into their application as models of cross-linguistic cognition.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02502v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02502v1,cs.CL

However, they remain unreliable and often depend on iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to 92\% on the most complex problems.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02503v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02503v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"

Specifically, we propose an interaction task implementing a narrative protocol (storytelling task) in which the human and the robot create a short imaginary story together, exchanging in turn cubes with creative images placed on them. To validate the protocol and the framework, experiments were performed to quantify the degree of usability and the quality of experience perceived by participants interacting with the system.

Decomposed Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Relevance   Assessment in UGC Platforms,"Xiaowei Yuan, Lei Jin, Haoxin Zhang, Yan Gao, Yi Wu, Yao Hu, Ziyang Huang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) plays a critical role in user-generated content (UGC) platforms, but its effectiveness depends heavily on accurate relevance assessment of query-document pairs. Despite recent advances in applying large language models (LLMs) to relevance modeling, UGC platforms present unique challenges: 1) ambiguous user intent due to sparse user feedback in RAG scenarios, and 2) substantial noise introduced by informal and unstructured language. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced Reasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed reasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring. R3A first leverages auxiliary high-ranked documents within the platform to infer latent query intent. It then performs verbatim fragment extraction to justify relevance decisions, thereby reducing errors caused by noisy UGC. Based on a reinforcement learning framework, R3A is optimized to mitigate distortions arising from ambiguous queries and unstructured content. Experimental results show that R3A significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of relevance accuracy, across both offline benchmarks and online experiments.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02506v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02506v1,"cs.IR, cs.AI"
Rethinking Transparent Object Grasping: Depth Completion with Monocular   Depth Estimation and Instance Mask,"Yaofeng Cheng, Xinkai Gao, Sen Zhang, Chao Zeng, Fusheng Zha, Lining Sun, Chenguang Yang","Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth, expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values. However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this, we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization capability.

M2: An Analytic System with Specialized Storage Engines for Multi-Model   Workloads,"Kyoseung Koo, Bogyeong Kim, Bongki Moon","Modern data analytic workloads increasingly require handling multiple data models simultaneously. Two primary approaches meet this need: polyglot persistence and multi-model database systems. Polyglot persistence employs a coordinator program to manage several independent database systems but suffers from high communication costs due to its physically disaggregated architecture. Meanwhile, existing multi-model database systems rely on a single storage engine optimized for a specific data model, resulting in inefficient processing across diverse data models. To address these limitations, we present M2, a multi-model analytic system with integrated storage engines. M2 treats all data models as first-class entities, composing query plans that incorporate operations across models. To effectively combine data from different models, the system introduces a specialized inter-model join algorithm called multi-stage hash join. Our evaluation demonstrates that M2 outperforms existing approaches by up to 188x speedup on multi-model analytics, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed techniques.",2025-08-04,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02508v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02508v2,cs.DB

In application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large problem instance.

Test-time Prompt Intervention,"Chenxu Yang, Qingyi Si, Mz Dai, Dingyu Yao, Mingyu Zheng, Minghui Chen, Zheng Lin, Weiping Wang","Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model (LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought (CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability and interpretability.

QuaDreamer: Controllable Panoramic Video Generation for Quadruped Robots,"Sheng Wu, Fei Teng, Hao Shi, Qi Jiang, Kai Luo, Kaiwei Wang, Kailun Yang","Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism.

Modular Arithmetic: Language Models Solve Math Digit by Digit,"Tanja Baeumel, Daniil Gurgurov, Yusser al Ghussin, Josef van Genabith, Simon Ostermann","While recent work has begun to uncover the internal strategies that Large Language Models (LLMs) employ for simple arithmetic tasks, a unified understanding of their underlying mechanisms is still lacking. We extend recent findings showing that LLMs represent numbers in a digit-wise manner and present evidence for the existence of digit-position-specific circuits that LLMs use to perform simple arithmetic tasks, i.e. modular subgroups of MLP neurons that operate independently on different digit positions (units, tens, hundreds). Notably, such circuits exist independently of model size and of tokenization strategy, i.e. both for models that encode longer numbers digit-by-digit and as one token. Using Feature Importance and Causal Interventions, we identify and validate the digit-position-specific circuits, revealing a compositional and interpretable structure underlying the solving of arithmetic problems in LLMs. Our interventions selectively alter the model's prediction at targeted digit positions, demonstrating the causal role of digit-position circuits in solving arithmetic tasks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02513v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02513v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Forrelation is Extremally Hard,"Uma Girish, Rocco Servedio","The Forrelation problem is a central problem that demonstrates an exponential separation between quantum and classical capabilities. In this problem, given query access to $n$-bit Boolean functions $f$ and $g$, the goal is to estimate the Forrelation function $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)$, which measures the correlation between $g$ and the Fourier transform of $f$.   In this work we provide a new linear algebraic perspective on the Forrelation problem, as opposed to prior analytic approaches. We establish a connection between the Forrelation problem and bent Boolean functions and through this connection, analyze an extremal version of the Forrelation problem where the goal is to distinguish between extremal instances of Forrelation, namely $(f,g)$ with $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)=1$ and $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)=-1$.   We show that this problem can be solved with one quantum query and success probability one, yet requires $\tilde{\Omega}\left(2^{n/4}\right)$ classical randomized queries, even for algorithms with a one-third failure probability, highlighting the remarkable power of one exact quantum query. We also study a restricted variant of this problem where the inputs $f,g$ are computable by small classical circuits and show classical hardness under cryptographic assumptions.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02514v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02514v1,"quant-ph, cs.CC"
PoeTone: A Framework for Constrained Generation of Structured Chinese   Songci with LLMs,"Zhan Qu, Shuzhou Yuan, Michael Färber","This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation, and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15 open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought. Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal conformity.

Engagement Prediction of Short Videos with Large Multimodal Models,"Wei Sun, Linhan Cao, Yuqin Cao, Weixia Zhang, Wen Wen, Kaiwei Zhang, Zijian Chen, Fangfang Lu, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai","The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background. Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc., but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities. Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably, VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on short-form video engagement prediction.

While detection methods have advanced, attributing audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition (ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes. Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability.

While digitalization, automation, and connectivity have enhanced safety and efficiency, they have also introduced new vulnerabilities. With 95% of data breaches attributed to human error, promoting cybersecurity awareness in transportation is increasingly critical.

To address this gap and enhance cyber awareness, this paper presents a large language model (LLM) based approach to extract and organize transportation related cyber incidents from publicly available datasets. A key contribution of this work is the use of generative AI to transform unstructured, heterogeneous cyber incident data into structured formats. Incidents were sourced from the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) List of Significant Cyber Incidents, the University of Maryland Cyber Events Database (UMCED), the European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC), the Maritime Cyber Attack Database (MCAD), and the U.S. DOT Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency (TraCR) Examples of Cyber Attacks in Transportation (2018 to 2022). These were classified by a fine tuned LLM into five transportation modes: aviation, maritime, rail, road, and multimodal, forming a transportation specific cyber incident database. Another key contribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval Augmented Generation question answering system, designed to enhance accessibility and practical use by enabling users to query the curated database for specific details on transportation related cyber incidents.

Causality and Interpretability for Electrical Distribution System faults,"Karthik Peddi, Sai Ram Aditya Parisineni, Hemanth Macharla, Mayukha Pal","Causal analysis helps us understand variables that are responsible for system failures. This improves fault detection and makes system more reliable. In this work, we present a new method that combines causal inference with machine learning to classify faults in electrical distribution systems (EDS) using graph-based models. We first build causal graphs using transfer entropy (TE). Each fault case is represented as a graph, where the nodes are features such as voltage and current, and the edges demonstrate how these features influence each other. Then, the graphs are classified using machine learning and GraphSAGE where the model learns from both the node values and the structure of the graph to predict the type of fault. To make the predictions understandable, we further developed an integrated approach using GNNExplainer and Captums Integrated Gradients to highlight the nodes (features) that influences the most on the final prediction. This gives us clear insights into the possible causes of the fault. Our experiments show high accuracy: 99.44% on the EDS fault dataset, which is better than state of art models. By combining causal graphs with machine learning, our method not only predicts faults accurately but also helps understand their root causes.

While deep learning models have achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.

Schüffler","Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways, Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker variability.

Failure-Aware Multi-Robot Coordination for Resilient and Adaptive Target   Tracking,"Peihan Li, Jiazhen Liu, Yuwei Wu, Lifeng Zhou","Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1) probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for the multi-robot systems community.",2025-08-04,2025-08-08,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02529v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02529v2,cs.RO

Understanding the Risks of Asphalt Art on the Reliability of   Surveillance Perception Systems,"Jin Ma, Abyad Enan, Long Cheng, Mashrur Chowdhury","Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns, particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections.

Contextual Graph Transformer: A Small Language Model for Enhanced   Engineering Document Information Extraction,"Karan Reddy, Mayukha Pal","Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text, often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering. CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram, and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical domains often require specialized language models with stronger contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses in real-world applications.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02532v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02532v1,"cs.CL, cs.LG"
Precision-Aware Video Compression for Reducing Bandwidth Requirements in   Video Communication for Vehicle Detection-Based Applications,"Abyad Enan, Jon C Calhoun, Mashrur Chowdhury","Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality. This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions, suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to 8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to 72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02533v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02533v1,cs.CV
Communication and Computation Efficient Split Federated Learning in   O-RAN,"Shunxian Gu, Chaoqun You, Bangbang Ren, Deke Guo","The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs). However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time, jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02534v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02534v1,"cs.LG, cs.DC"

Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.",2025-08-04,2025-08-08,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02773v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02773v2,"cs.CY, cs.AI, econ.GN, q-fin.EC"
ReGate: Enabling Power Gating in Neural Processing Units,"Yuqi Xue, Jian Huang","The energy efficiency of neural processing units (NPU) is playing a critical role in developing sustainable data centers. Our study with different generations of NPU chips reveals that 30%-72% of their energy consumption is contributed by static power dissipation, due to the lack of power management support in modern NPU chips. In this paper, we present ReGate, which enables fine-grained power-gating of each hardware component in NPU chips with hardware/software co-design. Unlike conventional power-gating techniques for generic processors, enabling power-gating in NPUs faces unique challenges due to the fundamental difference in hardware architecture and program execution model. To address these challenges, we carefully investigate the power-gating opportunities in each component of NPU chips and decide the best-fit power management scheme (i.e., hardware- vs. software-managed power gating). Specifically, for systolic arrays (SAs) that have deterministic execution patterns, ReGate enables cycle-level power gating at the granularity of processing elements (PEs) following the inherent dataflow execution in SAs. For inter-chip interconnect (ICI) and HBM controllers that have long idle intervals, ReGate employs a lightweight hardware-based idle-detection mechanism. For vector units and SRAM whose idle periods vary significantly depending on workload patterns, ReGate extends the NPU ISA and allows software like compilers to manage the power gating. With implementation on a production-level NPU simulator, we show that ReGate can reduce the energy consumption of NPU chips by up to 32.8% (15.5% on average), with negligible impact on AI workload performance. The hardware implementation of power-gating logic introduces less than 3.3% overhead in NPU chips.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02536v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02536v1,cs.AR
Solved in Unit Domain: JacobiNet for Differentiable Coordinate   Transformations,"Xi Chen, Jianchuan Yang, Junjie Zhang, Runnan Yang, Xu Liu, Hong Wang, Ziyu Ren, Wenqi Hu","Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement, and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions, and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to 0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02537v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02537v1,cs.LG
Hubness Reduction with Dual Bank Sinkhorn Normalization for Cross-Modal   Retrieval,"Zhengxin Pan, Haishuai Wang, Fangyu Wu, Peng Zhang, Jiajun Bu","The past decade has witnessed rapid advancements in cross-modal retrieval, with significant progress made in accurately measuring the similarity between cross-modal pairs. However, the persistent hubness problem, a phenomenon where a small number of targets frequently appear as nearest neighbors to numerous queries, continues to hinder the precision of similarity measurements. Despite several proposed methods to reduce hubness, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we analyze the widely-adopted Inverted Softmax approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing target probabilities during retrieval. Building on these insights, we propose a probability-balancing framework for more effective hubness reduction. We contend that balancing target probabilities alone is inadequate and, therefore, extend the framework to balance both query and target probabilities by introducing Sinkhorn Normalization (SN). Notably, we extend SN to scenarios where the true query distribution is unknown, showing that current methods, which rely solely on a query bank to estimate target hubness, produce suboptimal results due to a significant distributional gap between the query bank and targets. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Dual Bank Sinkhorn Normalization (DBSN), incorporating a corresponding target bank alongside the query bank to narrow this distributional gap. Our comprehensive evaluation across various cross-modal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval, video-text retrieval, and audio-text retrieval, demonstrates consistent performance improvements, validating the effectiveness of both SN and DBSN.

JustDense: Just using Dense instead of Sequence Mixer for Time Series   analysis,"TaekHyun Park, Yongjae Lee, Daesan Park, Dohee Kim, Hyerim Bae","Sequence and channel mixers, the core mechanism in sequence models, have become the de facto standard in time series analysis (TSA). However, recent studies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as attention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve comparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits attributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other architectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a central question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series analysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that systematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models with dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any sequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This substitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical foundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive experiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven state-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show that replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even superior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer benefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that ""deeper and more complex architectures are inherently better"" in TSA.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09153v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09153v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Automatic Identification of Machine Learning-Specific Code Smells,"Peter Hamfelt, Ricardo Britto, Lincoln Rocha, Camilo Almendra","Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria. This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer environment.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02541v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02541v1,"cs.SE, cs.AI"
Nicknames for Group Signatures,"Guillaume Quispe, Pierre Jouvelot, Gerard Memmi","Nicknames for Group Signatures (NGS) is a new signature scheme that extends Group Signatures (GS) with Signatures with Flexible Public Keys (SFPK). Via GS, each member of a group can sign messages on behalf of the group without revealing his identity, except to a designated auditor. Via SFPK, anyone can create new identities for a particular user, enabling anonymous transfers with only the intended recipient able to trace these new identities.   To prevent the potential abuses that this anonymity brings, NGS integrates flexible public keys into the GS framework to support auditable transfers. In addition to introducing NGS, we describe its security model and provide a mathematical construction proved secure in the Random Oracle Model.

An RGB-D Camera-Based Multi-Small Flying Anchors Control for Wire-Driven   Robots Connecting to the Environment,"Shintaro Inoue, Kento Kawaharazuka, Keita Yoneda, Sota Yuzaki, Yuta Sahara, Temma Suzuki, Kei Okada","In order to expand the operational range and payload capacity of robots, wire-driven robots that leverage the external environment have been proposed. It can exert forces and operate in spaces far beyond those dictated by its own structural limits. However, for practical use, robots must autonomously attach multiple wires to the environment based on environmental recognition-an operation so difficult that many wire-driven robots remain restricted to specialized, pre-designed environments. Here, in this study, we propose a robot that autonomously connects multiple wires to the environment by employing a multi-small flying anchor system, as well as an RGB-D camera-based control and environmental recognition method. Each flying anchor is a drone with an anchoring mechanism at the wire tip, allowing the robot to attach wires by flying into position. Using the robot's RGB-D camera to identify suitable attachment points and a flying anchor position, the system can connect wires in environments that are not specially prepared, and can also attach multiple wires simultaneously. Through this approach, a wire-driven robot can autonomously attach its wires to the environment, thereby realizing the benefits of wire-driven operation at any location.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02544v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02544v1,cs.RO
Thresholds of Queen covers,"Tirthankar Adhikari, Harman Agrawal, Anjali Bhagat, Ankita Dargad, Sahana Jahagirdar, Prem Kant, Urban Larsson, Sahil Wagh","We study optimal configurations of Queens on a square chessboard, defined as those covering the maximum number of squares. For a fixed number of Queens, $q$, we prove the existence of two thresholds in board size: a non-attacking threshold beyond which all optimal configurations are pairwise non-attacking, and a stabilizing threshold beyond which the set of optimal configurations becomes constant. Related studies on Queen domination, such as Tarnai and G\'asp\'ar (2007), focus on minimizing the number of Queens needed for full board coverage. Our approach, by contrast, fixes the number of Queens and analyzes optimal cover via a certain loss-function due to {\em internal loss} and {\em decentralization}. We demonstrate how the internal loss can be decomposed in terms of defined concepts, {\em balance} and {\em overlap concentration}. Moreover, by using our results, for sufficiently large board sizes, we find all optimal Queen configurations for all $2\le q\le 9$. And, whenever possible, we relate those solutions in terms of the classical problem of placing $q$ non-attacking Queens on a $q\times q$ board. For example, in case $q=8$, out of the twelve classical fundamental solutions, only three apply here as centralized patterns on large boards. On the other hand, the single classical fundamental solution for $q=6$ is never cover optimal on large boards, even if centralized, but another pattern that fits inside a $q\times (q+1)$ board applies.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02545v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02545v1,"math.CO, cs.DM, 05C69, 90C27, 05B40, 00A08"
What are you sinking? A geometric approach on attention sink,"Valeria Ruscio, Umberto Nanni, Fabrizio Silvestri","Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors) disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces. We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with AS.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02546v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02546v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL"

Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input.

A comprehensive understanding of perceived risks, benefits, and implementation challenges from those who design, deploy and experience these tools in real-world settings remains elusive. This study provides the first evidence-based account of key stakeholder perspectives on the relational, technical, and governance challenges raised by the integration of CP technologies into patient care. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 102 stakeholders: adolescent patients and their caregivers, frontline clinicians, technology developers, and ethics, legal, policy or philosophy scholars. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis by a multidisciplinary team; reliability was enhanced through double coding and consensus adjudication. Stakeholders articulated seven interlocking concern domains: (1) trustworthiness and data integrity; (2) patient-specific relevance; (3) utility and workflow integration; (4) regulation and governance; (5) privacy and data protection; (6) direct and indirect patient harms; and (7) philosophical critiques of reductionism. To operationalize humanistic safeguards, we propose ""personalized roadmaps"": co-designed plans that predetermine which metrics will be monitored, how and when feedback is shared, thresholds for clinical action, and procedures for reconciling discrepancies between algorithmic inferences and lived experience.

PrivAR: Real-Time Privacy Protection for Location-Based Augmented   Reality Applications,"Shafizur Rahman Seeam, Ye Zheng, Zhengxiong Li, Yidan Hu","Location-based augmented reality (LB-AR) applications, such as Pok\'emon Go, stream sub-second GPS updates to deliver responsive and immersive user experiences. However, this high-frequency location reporting introduces serious privacy risks. Protecting privacy in LB-AR is significantly more challenging than in traditional location-based services (LBS), as it demands real-time location protection with strong per-location and trajectory-level privacy guaranteed while maintaining low latency and high quality of service (QoS). Existing methods fail to meet these combined demands.   To fill the gap, we present PrivAR, the first client-side privacy framework for real-time LB-AR. PrivAR introduces two lightweight mechanisms: (i) Planar Staircase Mechanism (PSM) which designs a staircase-shaped distribution to generate noisy location with strong per-location privacy and low expected error; and (ii) Thresholded Reporting with PSM (TR-PSM), a selective scheme that releases a noisy location update only when a displacement exceeds a private threshold, enabling many-to-one mappings for enhanced trace-level privacy while preserving high QoS. We present theoretical analysis, extensive experiments on two public datasets and our proprietary GeoTrace dataset, and validate PrivAR on a Pok\'emon-Go-style prototype. Results show PrivAR improves QoS (Gamescore) by up to 50%, while increasing attacker error by 1.8x over baseline with an additional 0.06 milliseconds runtime overhead.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02551v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02551v1,cs.CR

Distributed consensus is a fundamental component of blockchain systems that enables secure, precise, and tamper-proof verification of data without relying on central authorities. Existing consensus protocols, nevertheless, suffer from drawbacks, some of which are related to scalability, resource consumption, and fault tolerance. We introduce Blockchain Epidemic Consensus Protocol (BECP), a novel fully decentralised consensus protocol for blockchain networks at a large scale. BECP follows epidemic communication principles, without fixed roles like validators or leaders, and achieves probabilistic convergence, efficient message dissemination, and tolerance to message delays. We provide an extensive experimental comparison of BECP against classic protocols like PAXOS, RAFT, and PBFT, and newer epidemic-based protocols like Avalanche and Snowman.

CSI Obfuscation: Single-Antenna Transmitters Can Not Hide from   Adversarial Multi-Antenna Radio Localization Systems,"Phillip Stephan, Florian Euchner, Stephan ten Brink","The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical triangulation using real-world channel measurements.

We further experiment a method to automatically align comparable documents using cross-lingual similarity measures. We investigate two cross-lingual similarity measures to align comparable documents. The first measure is based on bilingual dictionary, and the second measure is based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Experiments on several corpora show that the Cross-Lingual LSI (CL-LSI) measure outperforms the dictionary based measure.

Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling of ambiguous terms and misspellings.

"A ""good regulator theorem"" for embodied agents","Nathaniel Virgo, Martin Biehl, Manuel Baltieri, Matteo Capucci","In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that ""every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system."" Artificial Life has produced many examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having ""beliefs"" about its environment, which it ""updates"" in response to sensory input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however, and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.",2025-08-04,2025-08-21,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06326v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06326v2,"cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY"
RL-U$^2$Net: A Dual-Branch UNet with Reinforcement Learning-Assisted   Multimodal Feature Fusion for Accurate 3D Whole-Heart Segmentation,"Jierui Qu, Jianchun Zhao","Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal 3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02557v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02557v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"

We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy.

This framework establishes verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad, which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02560v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02560v1,"cs.LG, cs.CV, eess.IV, q-bio.NC, stat.ML"
Dynamic Feature Selection based on Rule-based Learning for Explainable   Classification with Uncertainty Quantification,"Javier Fumanal-Idocin, Raquel Fernandez-Peralta, Javier Andreu-Perez","Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set, DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however, existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02566v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02566v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
ASINT: Learning AS-to-Organization Mapping from Internet Metadata,"Yongzhe Xu, Weitong Li, Eeshan Umrani, Taejoong Chung","Accurately mapping Autonomous Systems (ASNs) to their owning or operating organizations underpins Internet measurement research and security applications. Yet existing approaches commonly rely solely on WHOIS or PeeringDB, missing important relationships (e.g., cross-regional aliases, parent-child ownership) and failing to unify organizations scattered across different RIR identifiers. We introduce ASINT, an end-to-end pipeline that fuses bulk registry data with unstructured Web sources, then employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to guide large language model (LLM) inference. Through a multi-stage procedure, ASINT merges ASNs into ""organization families,"" capturing nuanced ties beyond the scope of simpler heuristics.   ASINT maps 111,470 ASNs to 81,233 organization families; compared to both AS2ORG+ and AS-Sibling, ASINT identifies more cross-regional groupings (e.g., operator aliases, rebrands) that other datasets overlook. Moreover, our refined mappings enhance multiple security and measurement tasks: ASINT exposes 27.5% more intra-organizational RPKI misconfigurations, cuts false-positive hijack alarms by 9.4%, and lowers erroneous IP leasing inferences by 5.9%.   Finally, ASINT supports periodic updates and cost-sensitive LLM selection, demonstrating that broader Web evidence can provide a more accurate, evolving view of the Internet's organizational structure.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02571v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02571v1,cs.NI
Facility Location and $k$-Median with Fair Outliers,"Rajni Dabas, Samir Khuller, Emilie Rivkin","Classical clustering problems such as \emph{Facility Location} and \emph{$k$-Median} aim to efficiently serve a set of clients from a subset of facilities -- minimizing the total cost of facility openings and client assignments in Facility Location, and minimizing assignment (service) cost under a facility count constraint in $k$-Median. These problems are highly sensitive to outliers, and therefore researchers have studied variants that allow excluding a small number of clients as outliers to reduce cost. However, in many real-world settings, clients belong to different demographic or functional groups, and unconstrained outlier removal can disproportionately exclude certain groups, raising fairness concerns.   We study \emph{Facility Location with Fair Outliers}, where each group is allowed a specified number of outliers, and the objective is to minimize total cost while respecting group-wise fairness constraints. We present a bicriteria approximation with a $O(1/\epsilon)$ approximation factor and $(1+ 2\epsilon)$ factor violation in outliers per group. For \emph{$k$-Median with Fair Outliers}, we design a bicriteria approximation with a $4(1+\omega/\epsilon)$ approximation factor and $(\omega + \epsilon)$ violation in outliers per group improving on prior work by avoiding dependence on $k$ in outlier violations. We also prove that the problems are W[1]-hard parameterized by $\omega$, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis.   We complement our algorithmic contributions with a detailed empirical analysis, demonstrating that fairness can be achieved with negligible increase in cost and that the integrality gap of the standard LP is small in practice.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02572v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02572v1,cs.DS
Guess or Recall? Training CNNs to Classify and Localize Memorization in   LLMs,"Jérémie Dentan, Davide Buscaldi, Sonia Vanier","Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy and the attention weights involved in decoding.   We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories: memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights involved in each form of memorization.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02573v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02573v1,cs.CL
EHSAN: Leveraging ChatGPT in a Hybrid Framework for Arabic Aspect-Based   Sentiment Analysis in Healthcare,"Eman Alamoudi, Ellis Solaiman","Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment. To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes, with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02574v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02574v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SI"

In this work, we identify and systematically address these dual adversarial threats by introducing DINA (Dual Defense Against Internal Noise and Adversarial Attacks), a novel unified framework tailored specifically for NLP. Our approach adapts advanced noisy-label learning methods from computer vision and integrates them with adversarial training to simultaneously mitigate internal label sabotage and external adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from an online gaming service demonstrate that DINA significantly improves model robustness and accuracy compared to baseline models.

A Digital Twin-Based Simulation Framework for Safe Curve Speed   Estimation Using Unity,"Araf Rahman, M. Sabbir Salek, Mashrur Chowdhury, Wayne A. Sarasua","Horizontal curves are often associated with roadway crashes due to speed misjudgment and loss of control. With the growing adoption of autonomous and connected vehicles, the accurate estimation of safe speed at curves is becoming increasingly important. The widely used AASHTO design method for safe curve speed estimation relies on an analytical equation based on a simplified point mass model, which often uses conservative parameters to account for vehicular and environmental variations. This paper presents a digital twin-based framework for estimating safe speed at curves using a physics-driven virtual environment developed in the Unity engine. In this framework, a real-world horizontal road curve is selected, and vehicle speed data are collected using a radar gun under various weather conditions. A 3D model of the road curve is constructed in a Unity environment using roadway geometric and elevation data. A parameterized vehicle model is integrated, allowing for variations in mass, acceleration, and center of gravity to reflect different vehicle types and loading scenarios. This simulation identifies the maximum safe speed at which a vehicle can traverse the given curve, providing a more vehicle and environment-specific estimate of the safe operating speed. The study validated that the safe curve speed estimates generated by the simulation were consistent with the real-world speed values observed at a curve. This study demonstrates how a physics-based digital twin can estimate a safer and more adaptive operating speed for vehicles traversing horizontal curves.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14046v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14046v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, F.2.2; I.2.7"
Automated Construction of Artificial Lattice Structures with Designer   Electronic States,"Ganesh Narasimha, Mykola Telychko, Wooin Yang, Arthur P. Baddorf, P. Ganesh, An-Ping Li, Rama Vasudevan","Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. To underpin of efficiency of our approach we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure.

CAMA: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models with   Causal Knowledge,"Lei Zan, Keli Zhang, Ruichu Cai, Lujia Pan","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician (\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit, reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies. To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph, which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations alone.",2025-08-04,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02583v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02583v2,"cs.AI, cs.LG"
MArgE: Meshing Argumentative Evidence from Multiple Large Language   Models for Justifiable Claim Verification,"Ming Pok Ng, Junqi Jiang, Gabriel Freedman, Antonio Rago, Francesca Toni","Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However, current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions, providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models (4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining multiple LLM outputs.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02584v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02584v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

We analyze dynamics of core components when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach.

Intensional FOL over Belnap's Billatice for Strong-AI Robotics,Zoran Majkic,"AGI (Strong AI) aims to create intelligent robots that are quasi indistinguishable from the human mind. Like a child, the AGI robot would have to learn through input and experiences, constantly progressing and advancing its abilities over time. The AGI robot would require an intelligence more close to human's intelligence: it would have a self-aware consciousness that has the ability to solve problems, learn, and plan. Based on this approach an Intensional many-sorted First-order Logic (IFOL), as an extension of a standard FOL with Tarskian's semantics, is proposed in order to avoid the problems of standard 2-valued FOL with paradoxes (inconsistent formulae) and a necessity for robots to work with incomplete (unknown) knowledge as well. This is a more sophisticated version of IFOL with the same syntax but different semantics, able to deal with truth-ordering and knowledge-ordering as well, based on the well known Belnap's billatice with four truth-values that extend the set of classical two truth-values.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02774v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02774v1,cs.LO
CharBench: Evaluating the Role of Tokenization in Character-Level Tasks,"Omri Uzan, Yuval Pinter","Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization, leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of 43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character, suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs. We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-06,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02591v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02591v2,cs.CL

Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning have enabled automated surgical skill assessment, demonstrating the feasibility of automatic competency evaluation. However, it is unclear whether such Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven feedback can contribute to skill acquisition. Here, we examine the effectiveness of explainable AI (XAI)-generated feedback in surgical training through a human-AI study. We create a simulation-based training framework that utilizes XAI to analyze videos and extract surgical skill proxies related to primitive actions. Our intervention provides automated, user-specific feedback by comparing trainee performance to expert benchmarks and highlighting deviations from optimal execution through understandable proxies for actionable guidance. In a prospective user study with medical students, we compare the impact of XAI-guided feedback against traditional video-based coaching on task outcomes, cognitive load, and trainees' perceptions of AI-assisted learning. Results showed improved cognitive load and confidence post-intervention. While no differences emerged between the two feedback types in reducing performance gaps or practice adjustments, trends in the XAI group revealed desirable effects where participants more closely mimicked expert practice.

As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class.

Fully Decentralised Consensus for Extreme-scale Blockchain,"Siamak Abdi, Giuseppe Di Fatta, Atta Badii, Giancarlo Fortino","Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger technology that has been widely adopted in many sectors for various applications such as cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and supply chain management. Distributed consensus is a fundamental component of blockchain, which is required to ensure trust, security, and integrity of the data stored and the transactions processed in the blockchain. Various consensus algorithms have been developed, each affected from certain issues such as node failures, high resource consumption, collusion, etc. This work introduces a fully decentralised consensus protocol, Blockchain Epidemic Consensus Protocol (BECP), suitable for very large and extreme-scale blockchain systems. The proposed approach leverages the benefits of epidemic protocols, such as no reliance on a fixed set of validators or leaders, probabilistic guarantees of convergence, efficient use of network resources, and tolerance to node and network failures. A comparative experimental analysis has been carried out with traditional protocols including PAXOS, RAFT, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), as well as a relatively more recent protocol such as Avalanche, which is specifically designed for very large-scale systems. The results illustrate how BECP outperforms them in terms of throughput, scalability and consensus latency. BECP achieves an average of 1.196 times higher throughput in terms of consensus on items and 4.775 times better average consensus latency. Furthermore, BECP significantly reduces the number of messages compared to Avalanche.

Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks,"Xudong Wang, Tongxin Li, Chris Ding, Jicong Fan","Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces, struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training, we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs.

StructSynth: Leveraging LLMs for Structure-Aware Tabular Data Synthesis   in Low-Data Regimes,"Siyi Liu, Yujia Zheng, Yongqi Zhang","The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution, traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data, leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture. First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated data respects the underlying structure by design.

We demonstrate FreB's effectiveness by tackling diverse case studies in the physical sciences: identifying unknown sources under dataset shift, reconciling competing theoretical models, and mitigating selection bias and systematics in observational studies.

However, current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97% improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M.

LMAR: Language Model Augmented Retriever for Domain-specific Knowledge   Indexing,"Yao Zhao, Yantian Ding, Zhiyue Zhang, Dapeng Yao, Yanxun Xu","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with domain-specific knowledge due to performance deterioration of pre-trained embeddings and prohibitive computational costs of large language model (LLM)-based retrievers. While fine-tuning data augmentation embedding models offers a promising direction, its effectiveness is limited by the need for high-quality training data and reliable chunking strategies that preserve contextual integrity. We propose LMAR (Language Model Augmented Retriever), a model-agnostic framework that addresses these challenges by combining LLM-guided data synthesis with contrastive embedding adaptation and efficient text clustering. LMAR consists of a two-stage pipeline: (1) Triplet sampling and synthetic data augmentation, where LLMs act as both labeler and validator to ensure high-fidelity supervision throughout the pipeline. Experimental results across multiple domain-specific benchmark datasets demonstrate that LMAR outperforms multiple baseline models, while maintaining moderate hardware requirements and low latency. Its model-agnostic nature further enables seamless integration with emerging RAG architectures and text embedding models, ensuring continual improvements without redesigning the pipeline. These results highlight LMAR as a practical and cost-effective solution for scalable domain-specific adaptation.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05672v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05672v1,"cs.IR, cs.AI"
Entity Representation Learning Through Onsite-Offsite Graph for   Pinterest Ads,"Jiayin Jin, Zhimeng Pan, Yang Tang, Jiarui Feng, Kungang Li, Chongyuan Xiang, Jiacheng Li, Runze Su, Siping Ji, Han Sun, Ling Leng, Prathibha Deshikachar","Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage}, TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction.

Existing solutions often rely on auditory cues but do not fully integrate rich sensory feedback or support spatial navigation, limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces PunchPulse, a virtual reality (VR) boxing exergame designed to motivate BLV users to reach and sustain moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels. Over a seven-month, multi-phased study, PunchPulse was iteratively refined with three BLV co-designers, informed by two early pilot testers, and evaluated by six additional BLV user-study participants. Data collection included both qualitative (researcher observations, SOPI) and quantitative (MVPA zones, aid usage, completion times) measures of physical exertion and gameplay performance. The user study revealed that all participants reached moderate MVPA thresholds, with high levels of immersion and engagement observed.

Meta-RAG on Large Codebases Using Code Summarization,"Vali Tawosi, Salwa Alamir, Xiaomo Liu, Manuela Veloso","Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation. We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores 84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02611v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02611v1,"cs.SE, cs.AI"
Jacobi-accelerated FFT-based solver for smooth high-contrast data,"Martin Ladecký, Ivana Pultarová, François Bignonnet, Indre Jödicke, Jan Zeman, Lars Pastewka","The computational efficiency and rapid convergence of fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based solvers render them a powerful numerical tool for periodic cell problems in multiscale modeling. On regular grids, they tend to outperform traditional numerical methods. However, we show that their convergence slows down significantly when applied to microstructures with smooth, highly-contrasted coefficients. To address this loss of performance, we introduce a Green-Jacobi preconditioner, an enhanced successor to the standard discrete Green preconditioner that preserves the quasilinear complexity, $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$, of conventional FFT-based solvers. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Jacobi-accelerated FFT (J-FFT) solver within a linear elastic framework. For problems characterized by smooth data and high material contrast, J-FFT significantly reduces the iteration count of the conjugate gradient method compared to the standard Green preconditioner. These findings are particularly relevant for phase-field fracture simulations, density-based topology optimization, and solvers that use adaption of the grid, which all introduce smooth variations in the material properties that challenge conventional FFT-based solvers.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02613v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02613v1,"math.NA, cs.NA"
DeepKoopFormer: A Koopman Enhanced Transformer Based Architecture for   Time Series Forecasting,"Ali Forootani, Mohammad Khosravi, Masoud Barati","Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible, interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and dynamical settings.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02616v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02616v1,cs.LG

Vougioukas, Zhaodan Kong","Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in orchards presents significant challenges due to obstacles and GPS-deprived environments. In this work, we introduce a learning-based approach to achieve vision-based navigation of UAVs within orchard rows. Our method employs a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based controller, trained with an intervention-based learning framework that allows the UAV to learn a visuomotor policy from human experience. We validate our approach in real orchard environments with a custom-built quadrotor platform. Field experiments demonstrate that after only a few iterations of training, the proposed VAE-based controller can autonomously navigate the UAV based on a front-mounted camera stream. The controller exhibits strong obstacle avoidance performance, achieves longer flying distances with less human assistance, and outperforms existing algorithms. Furthermore, we show that the policy generalizes effectively to novel environments and maintains competitive performance across varying conditions and speeds. This research not only advances UAV autonomy but also holds significant potential for precision agriculture, improving efficiency in orchard monitoring and management.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02617v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02617v1,cs.RO
Mitigating Attention Hacking in Preference-Based Reward Modeling via   Interaction Distillation,"Jianxiang Zang, Meiling Ning, Shihan Dou, Jiazheng Zhang, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for providing reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and rejected sequences. To address this ""attention hacking"", we propose ""Interaction Distillation"", a novel training framework for more adequate preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention, and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02618v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02618v1,cs.CL

HealthFlow autonomously refines its own high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base.

Noosemia: toward a Cognitive and Phenomenological Account of   Intentionality Attribution in Human-Generative AI Interaction,"Enrico De Santis, Antonello Rizzi","This paper introduces and formalizes Noosem\`ia, a novel cognitive-phenomenological pattern emerging from human interaction with generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance, but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia, animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the phenomenological withdrawal of such projections.

HiFACTMix: A Code-Mixed Benchmark and Graph-Aware Model for   EvidenceBased Political Claim Verification in Hinglish,"Rakesh Thakur, Sneha Sharma, Gauri Chopra","Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding, claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its verdicts.

However, conventional DMD methods are limited to matrix-based formulations, which might be inefficient or inadequate for modeling inherently multidimensional data including images, videos, and higher-order networks. In this letter, we propose tensor dynamic mode decomposition (TDMD), a novel extension of DMD to third-order tensors based on the recently developed T-product framework. By incorporating tensor factorization techniques, TDMD achieves more efficient computation and better preservation of spatial and temporal structures in multiway data for tasks such as state reconstruction and dynamic component separation, compared to standard DMD with data flattening.

However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.",2025-08-04,2025-08-06,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02629v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02629v2,"cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CL"
"What Is Your AI Agent Buying? Evaluation, Implications and Emerging   Questions for Agentic E-Commerce","Amine Allouah, Omar Besbes, Josué D Figueroa, Yash Kanoria, Akshit Kumar","Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking, vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why? We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption of a universal ""top"" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products, raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy, platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02630v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02630v1,"cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.HC, cs.MA, econ.GN, q-fin.EC"

Unlike standard attention mechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses layer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on previous layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections through pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves $2$--$10\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers, maintains $>95\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and learns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency modeling.

Most existing control strategies assume cohesive target behavior, which frequently fails in practical applications where targets exhibit stochastic autonomous behavior. This paper presents a hierarchical learning-based control architecture that decomposes the shepherding problem into a high-level decision-making module and a low-level motion control component. The proposed distributed control system synthesizes effective control policies directly from closed-loop experience without requiring explicit inter-agent communication or prior knowledge of target dynamics. The decentralized architecture achieves cooperative control behavior through emergent coordination without centralized supervision. Experimental validation demonstrates superior closed-loop performance compared to state-of-the-art heuristic control methods, achieving 100\% success rates with improved settling times and control efficiency.

Actionability is defined as the ability to transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of America counties.

However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned.

Instance-Optimal Uniformity Testing and Tracking,"Guy Blanc, Clément L. Canonne, Erik Waingarten","In the uniformity testing task, an algorithm is provided with samples from an unknown probability distribution over a (known) finite domain, and must decide whether it is the uniform distribution, or, alternatively, if its total variation distance from uniform exceeds some input distance parameter. This question has received a significant amount of interest and its complexity is, by now, fully settled. Yet, we argue that it fails to capture many scenarios of interest, and that its very definition as a gap problem in terms of a prespecified distance may lead to suboptimal performance.   To address these shortcomings, we introduce the problem of uniformity tracking, whereby an algorithm is required to detect deviations from uniformity (however they may manifest themselves) using as few samples as possible, and be competitive against an optimal algorithm knowing the distribution profile in hindsight. Our main contribution is a $\operatorname{polylog}(\operatorname{opt})$-competitive uniformity tracking algorithm.

Reframing Pattern: A Comprehensive Approach to a Composite Visual   Variable,"Tingying He, Jason Dykes, Petra Isenberg, Tobias Isenberg","We present a new comprehensive theory for explaining, exploring, and using pattern as a visual variable in visualization. Although patterns have long been used for data encoding and continue to be valuable today, their conceptual foundations are precarious: the concepts and terminology used across the research literature and in practice are inconsistent, making it challenging to use patterns effectively and to conduct research to inform their use. To address this problem, we conduct a comprehensive cross-disciplinary literature review that clarifies ambiguities around the use of ""pattern"" and ""texture"". As a result, we offer a new consistent treatment of pattern as a composite visual variable composed of structured groups of graphic primitives that can serve as marks for encoding data individually and collectively. This new and widely applicable formulation opens a sizable design space for the visual variable pattern, which we formalize as a new system comprising three sets of variables: the spatial arrangement of primitives, the appearance relationships among primitives, and the retinal visual variables that characterize individual primitives. We show how our pattern system relates to existing visualization theory and highlight opportunities for visualization design.

The performance of the exact model is benchmarked against a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is demonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational results are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to proven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40 aircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all tested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly outperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic benefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between solution time and optimality.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02640v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02640v1,"math.OC, cs.AI, cs.CE, 90C11 (Primary), 90B35, 90C27 (Secondary)"

Ulissi, Anuroop Sriram","Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) of molecular crystals plays a central role in applications, such as pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. CSP is challenging and computationally expensive due to the need to explore a large search space with sufficient accuracy to capture energy differences of a few kJ/mol between polymorphs. Dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT) provides the required accuracy but its computational cost is impractical for a large number of putative structures. We introduce FastCSP, an open-source, high-throughput CSP workflow based on machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). FastCSP combines random structure generation using Genarris 3.0 with geometry relaxation and free energy calculations powered entirely by the Universal Model for Atoms (UMA) MLIP. We benchmark FastCSP on a curated set of 28 mostly rigid molecules, demonstrating that our workflow consistently generates known experimental structures and ranks them within 5 kJ/mol per molecule of the global minimum. Our results demonstrate that universal MLIPs can be used across diverse compounds without requiring system-specific tuning. Moreover, the speed and accuracy afforded by UMA eliminate the need for classical force fields in the early stages of CSP and for final re-ranking with DFT. The open-source release of the entire FastCSP workflow significantly lowers the barrier to accessing CSP. CSP results for a single system can be obtained within hours on tens of modern GPUs, making high-throughput crystal structure prediction feasible for a broad range of scientific applications.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02641v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02641v1,"physics.chem-ph, cs.LG"
CAK: Emergent Audio Effects from Minimal Deep Learning,Austin Rockman,"We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK), where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN), which reframes adversarial training from ""is this real?"" to ""did you apply the requested value?"" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data, enabling new approaches to effect design.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02643v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02643v1,"cs.LG, cs.SD, eess.AS"
D2PPO: Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss,"Guowei Zou, Weibing Li, Hejun Wu, Yukun Qian, Yuhang Wang, Haitao Wang","Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless, diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO (Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations, thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks, D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident in complex tasks.

Evaluating Variance in Visual Question Answering Benchmarks,Nikitha SR,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements, the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates, overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism, model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability. Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02645v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02645v1,cs.CV
Manip4Care: Robotic Manipulation of Human Limbs for Solving Assistive   Tasks,"Yubin Koh, Ahmed H. Qureshi","Enabling robots to grasp and reposition human limbs can significantly enhance their ability to provide assistive care to individuals with severe mobility impairments, particularly in tasks such as robot-assisted bed bathing and dressing. However, existing assistive robotics solutions often assume that the human remains static or quasi-static, limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we present Manip4Care, a modular simulation pipeline that enables robotic manipulators to grasp and reposition human limbs effectively. Our approach features a physics simulator equipped with built-in techniques for grasping and repositioning while considering biomechanical and collision avoidance constraints. Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with force closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to generate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical constraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks in both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age groups with differing shoulder joint limits. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach for limb manipulation using a real-world mannequin and further showcase its effectiveness in bed bathing tasks.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02649v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02649v1,cs.RO
RC-Gossip: Information Freshness in Clustered Networks with   Rate-Changing Gossip,"Irtiza Hasan, Ahmed Arafa","A clustered gossip network is considered in which a source updates its information over time, and end-nodes, organized in clusters through clusterheads, are keeping track of it. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we assess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart mechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip (RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that need it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number of fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we present an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based approach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness of nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared to traditional gossiping techniques.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02657v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02657v1,"cs.IT, cs.NI, eess.SP, math.IT"

Existing paradigms are mainly confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages: 1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery: restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic methods.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02660v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02660v1,cs.CV
Breaking the Top-$K$ Barrier: Advancing Top-$K$ Ranking Metrics   Optimization in Recommender Systems,"Weiqin Yang, Jiawei Chen, Shengjia Zhang, Peng Wu, Yuegang Sun, Yan Feng, Chun Chen, Can Wang","In the realm of recommender systems (RS), Top-$K$ ranking metrics such as NDCG@$K$ are the gold standard for evaluating recommendation performance. However, during the training of recommendation models, optimizing NDCG@$K$ poses significant challenges due to its inherent discontinuous nature and the intricate Top-$K$ truncation. Recent efforts to optimize NDCG@$K$ have either overlooked the Top-$K$ truncation or suffered from high computational costs and training instability. To overcome these limitations, we propose SoftmaxLoss@$K$ (SL@$K$), a novel recommendation loss tailored for NDCG@$K$ optimization. Specifically, we integrate the quantile technique to handle Top-$K$ truncation and derive a smooth upper bound for optimizing NDCG@$K$ to address discontinuity. The resulting SL@$K$ loss has several desirable properties, including theoretical guarantees, ease of implementation, computational efficiency, gradient stability, and noise robustness.

LOST: Low-rank and Sparse Pre-training for Large Language Models,"Jiaxi Li, Lu Yin, Li Shen, Jinjin Xu, Liwu Xu, Tianjin Huang, Wenwu Wang, Shiwei Liu, Xilu Wang","While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However, existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices, preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead.

MedVLThinker: Simple Baselines for Multimodal Medical Reasoning,"Xiaoke Huang, Juncheng Wu, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Yuyin Zhou","Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by enabling models to ``think before responding"" via chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o.

Raw Data Matters: Enhancing Prompt Tuning by Internal Augmentation on   Vision-Language Models,"Haoyang Li, Liang Wang, Chao Wang, Siyu Zhou, Jing Jiang, Yan Peng, Guodong Long","For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach. Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically, AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and generalization capability without using appended external knowledge.

Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization: Self-Adaptive Reasoning for   Science,"Newman Cheng, Gordon Broadbent, William Chappell","The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery, they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training, OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific decision-making processes.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02789v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02789v1,cs.AI

The hemivariational inequality describes the flow of a viscous, incompressible fluid through a saturated porous medium, subject to a nonsmooth, nonconvex friction-type slip boundary condition. The incompressibility constraint is handled via a mixed variational formulation. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions by utilizing the pseudomonotonicity and coercivity properties of the underlying operators and provide a detailed error analysis of the proposed numerical scheme. Under suitable regularity assumptions, the method achieves optimal convergence rates with low-order mixed finite element pairs. The scheme is implemented using the $\text{P1b/P1}$ element pair, and numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical results and confirm the expected convergence behavior.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02797v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02797v1,"math.NA, cs.NA"

C-V2X deployments operate under strict protocol compliance with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the Society of Automotive Engineers Standard (SAE) J2735 specifications to ensure interoperability. This paper presents a real-world testbed evaluation of protocol-compliant Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flooding and oversized Basic Safety Message (BSM) attacks that 7 exploit transport- and application-layer vulnerabilities in C-V2X. The attacks presented in this study transmit valid messages over standard PC5 sidelinks, fully adhering to 3GPP and SAE J2735 specifications, but at abnormally high rates and with oversized payloads that overload the receiver resources without breaching any protocol rules such as IEEE 1609. Using a real-world connected vehicle 11 testbed with commercially available On-Board Units (OBUs), we demonstrate that high-rate UDP flooding and oversized payload of BSM flooding can severely degrade FCW performance. Results show that UDP flooding alone reduces packet delivery ratio by up to 87% and increases latency to over 400ms, while oversized BSM floods overload receiver processing resources, delaying or completely suppressing FCW alerts. When UDP and BSM attacks are executed simultaneously, they cause near-total communication failure, preventing FCW warnings entirely.

DreamVVT: Mastering Realistic Video Virtual Try-On in the Wild via a   Stage-Wise Diffusion Transformer Framework,"Tongchun Zuo, Zaiyu Huang, Shuliang Ning, Ente Lin, Chao Liang, Zerong Zheng, Jianwen Jiang, Yuan Zhang, Mingyuan Gao, Xin Dong","Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images. These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content and temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

Identifying the true-positive alerts and repairing the defects in the associated code are huge efforts that automated program repair (APR) tools can help with. Our experience showed us that APR can reduce the number of SA alerts significantly and reduce the manual effort of analysts to review code. This engineering experience paper details the application of design, development, and performance testing to an APR tool we built that repairs C/C++ code associated with 3 categories of alerts produced by multiple SA tools. Its repairs are simple and local. Furthermore, our findings convinced the maintainers of the CERT Coding Standards to re-assess and update the metrics used to assess when violations of guidelines are detectable or repairable. We discuss engineering design choices made to support goals of trustworthiness and acceptability to developers. Our APR tool repaired 8718 out of 9234 alerts produced by one SA tool on one codebase. It can repair 3 flaw categories. For 2 flaw categories, 2 SA tools, and 2 codebases, our tool repaired or dismissed as false positives over 80% of alerts, on average. Tests showed repairs did not appreciably degrade the performance of the code or cause new alerts to appear (with the possible exception of sqlite3.c). This paper describes unique contributions that include a new empirical analysis of SA data, our selection method for flaw categories to repair, publication of our APR tool, and a dataset of SA alerts from open-source SA tools run on open-source codebases. It discusses positive and negative results and lessons learned.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02820v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02820v1,"cs.SE, cs.PL"
Finding Colorings in One-Sided Expanders,"Rares-Darius Buhai, Yiding Hua, David Steurer, Andor Vári-Kakas","We establish new algorithmic guarantees with matching hardness results for coloring and independent set problems in one-sided expanders and related classes of graphs. For example, given a $3$-colorable regular one-sided expander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative size at least $1/2-o(1)$ or a proper $3$-coloring for all but an $o(1)$ fraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to $0$ with the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This result improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025) developing an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative size at least $0.01$ in such graphs. We also obtain an efficient $1.6667$-factor approximation algorithm for VERTEX COVER in sufficiently strong regular one-sided expanders, improving over a previous $(2-\epsilon)$-factor approximation in such graphs for an unspecified constant $\epsilon>0$.   We propose a new stratification of $k$-COLORING in terms of $k$-by-$k$ matrices akin to predicate sets for constraint satisfaction problems. We prove that whenever this matrix has repeated rows, the corresponding coloring problem is NP-hard for one-sided expanders under the Unique Games Conjecture. On the other hand, if this matrix has no repeated rows, our algorithms can solve the corresponding coloring problem on one-sided expanders in polynomial time.   As starting point for our algorithmic results, we show a property of graph spectra that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before: The number of negative eigenvalues smaller than $-\tau$ is at most $O(1/\tau^{2})$ times the number of eigenvalues larger than $\tau^{2}/2$. While this result allows us to bound the number of eigenvalues bounded away from $0$ in one-sided spectral expanders, this property alone is insufficient for our algorithmic results.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02825v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02825v1,cs.DS
TransAM: Transformer-Based Agent Modeling for Multi-Agent Systems via   Local Trajectory Encoding,"Conor Wallace, Umer Siddique, Yongcan Cao","Agent modeling is a critical component in developing effective policies within multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to form beliefs about the behaviors, intentions, and competencies of others. Many existing approaches assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to higher episodic returns.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02826v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02826v1,"cs.MA, cs.AI"
Automated Validation of LLM-based Evaluators for Software Engineering   Artifacts,"Ora Nova Fandina, Eitan Farchi, Shmulik Froimovich, Rami Katan, Alice Podolsky, Orna Raz, Avi Ziv","Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts. However, establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality.   We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation), an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with expected ordering.   A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps.   While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks. These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams to support model release decisions.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02827v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02827v1,"cs.SE, cs.AI"
Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA,Adam Colton,"In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA), features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation. These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for effective self-supervised visual representation learning.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02829v1,cs.CV
GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing,"Mikołaj Zieliński, Krzysztof Byrski, Tomasz Szczepanik, Przemysław Spurek","Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features. Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation, bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

On the Theory and Practice of GRPO: A Trajectory-Corrected Approach with   Fast Convergence,"Lei Pang, Ruinan Jin","Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one. However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably, this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.   Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed variant.",2025-08-04,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02833v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02833v2,cs.LG
Defending Against Knowledge Poisoning Attacks During Retrieval-Augmented   Generation,"Kennedy Edemacu, Vinay M. Shashidhar, Micheal Tuape, Dan Abudu, Beakcheol Jang, Jong Wook Kim","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source. Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones in the design of our proposed approaches.

While recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA, they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding, multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.

State dimension reduction of recurrent equilibrium networks with   contraction and robustness preservation,M. F. Shakib,"Recurrent equilibrium networks (RENs) are effective for learning the dynamics of complex dynamical systems with certified contraction and robustness properties through unconstrained learning. While this opens the door to learning large-scale RENs, deploying such large-scale RENs in real-time applications on resource-limited devices remains challenging. Since a REN consists of a feedback interconnection of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics and static activation functions, this article proposes a projection-based approach to reduce the state dimension of the LTI component of a trained REN. One of the two projection matrices is dedicated to preserving contraction and robustness by leveraging the already-learned REN contraction certificate. The other projection matrix is iteratively updated to improve the accuracy of the reduced-order REN based on necessary $h_2$-optimality conditions for LTI model reduction. Numerical examples validate the approach, demonstrating significant state dimension reduction with limited accuracy loss while preserving contraction and robustness.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02843v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02843v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation,"Anghong Du, Nay Aung, Theodoros N. Arvanitis, Stefan K. Piechnik, Joao A C Lima, Steffen E. Petersen, Le Zhang","High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution, achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset. Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02844v1,cs.CV
Integrating Machine Learning with Multimodal Monitoring System Utilizing   Acoustic and Vision Sensing to Evaluate Geometric Variations in Laser   Directed Energy Deposition,"Ke Xu, Chaitanya Krishna Prasad Vallabh, Souran Manoochehri","Laser directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing struggles with consistent part quality due to complex melt pool dynamics and process variations. While much research targets defect detection, little work has validated process monitoring systems for evaluating melt pool dynamics and process quality. This study presents a novel multimodal monitoring framework, synergistically integrating contact-based acoustic emission (AE) sensing with coaxial camera vision to enable layer-wise identification and evaluation of geometric variations in DED parts. The experimental study used three part configurations: a baseline part without holes, a part with a 3mm diameter through-hole, and one with a 5mm through-hole to test the system's discerning capabilities. Raw sensor data was preprocessed: acoustic signals were filtered for time-domain and frequency-domain feature extraction, while camera data underwent melt pool segmentation and morphological feature extraction. Multiple machine learning algorithms (including SVM, random forest, and XGBoost) were evaluated to find the optimal model for classifying layer-wise geometric variations. The integrated multimodal strategy achieved a superior classification performance of 94.4%, compared to 87.8% for AE only and 86.7% for the camera only. Validation confirmed the integrated system effectively captures both structural vibration signatures and surface morphological changes tied to the geometric variations. While this study focuses on specific geometries, the demonstrated capability to discriminate between features establishes a technical foundation for future applications in characterizing part variations like geometric inaccuracies and manufacturing-induced defects.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02847v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02847v1,"eess.SP, cs.SY, eess.IV, eess.SY"
SecoustiCodec: Cross-Modal Aligned Streaming Single-Codecbook Speech   Codec,"Chunyu Qiang, Haoyu Wang, Cheng Gong, Tianrui Wang, Ruibo Fu, Tao Wang, Ruilong Chen, Jiangyan Yi, Zhengqi Wen, Chen Zhang, Longbiao Wang, Jianwu Dang, Jianhua Tao","Speech codecs serve as a crucial bridge in unifying speech and text language models. Existing codec methods face several challenges in semantic encoding, such as residual paralinguistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion), insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack of support for streaming. To address these challenges, we propose SecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook space. To ensure semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity, paralinguistic encoding is introduced to bridge the information gap between semantic and acoustic encoding. A semantic-only efficient quantization method based on VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) is proposed. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens while maintaining high codebook utilization. A semantic disentanglement method based on contrastive learning is proposed, which aligns text and speech in a joint multimodal frame-level space, effectively removing paralinguistic information from semantic encoding. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage optimization strategy is proposed to ensure robust and stable convergence. Figure~\ref{fig:pesq_kbps_below_2kbps} shows SecoustiCodec achieves SOTA (state-of-the-art) reconstruction quality (PESQ) of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps.

Modeling Annotator Disagreement with Demographic-Aware Experts and   Synthetic Perspectives,"Yinuo Xu, Veronica Derricks, Allison Earl, David Jurgens","We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model, DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies depend on dataset structure.

The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a security-critical task.

Compositional Quantum Control Flow with Efficient Compilation in Qunity,"Mikhail Mints, Finn Voichick, Leonidas Lampropoulos, Robert Rand","Most existing quantum programming languages are based on the quantum circuit model of computation, as higher-level abstractions are particularly challenging to implement - especially ones relating to quantum control flow. The Qunity language, proposed by Voichick et al., offered such an abstraction in the form of a quantum control construct, with great care taken to ensure that the resulting language is still realizable. However, Qunity lacked a working implementation, and the originally proposed compilation procedure was very inefficient, with even simple quantum algorithms compiling to unreasonably large circuits.   In this work, we focus on the efficient compilation of high-level quantum control flow constructs, using Qunity as our starting point. We introduce a wider range of abstractions on top of Qunity's core language that offer compelling trade-offs compared to its existing control construct. We create a complete implementation of a Qunity compiler, which converts high-level Qunity code into the quantum assembly language OpenQASM 3.

MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a   Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model,"Tianheng Zhu, Yiheng Feng","As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives (TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position, speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will be open-sourced upon publication.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02858v1,cs.CV
Comparative Evaluation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Autoencoders and Orthogonal   Autoencoders for Fault Detection with Varying Training Set Sizes,"Enrique Luna Villagómez, Vladimir Mahalec","Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families. While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants, each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder (OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets. EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms. The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency, making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial settings.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02860v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02860v1,cs.LG

Boon, Wouter Tonnon, Enrico Zampa","In this work, we show how to impose no-slip boundary conditions for an H(curl)-based formulation for incompressible Stokes flow, which is used in structure-preserving discretizations of Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamics equations. At first glance, it seems straightforward to apply no-slip boundary conditions: the tangential part is an essential boundary condition on H(curl) and the normal component can be naturally enforced through integration-by-parts of the divergence term. However, we show that this can lead to an ill-posed discretization and propose a Nitsche-based finite element method instead. We analyze the discrete system, establishing stability and deriving a priori error estimates. Numerical experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate optimal convergence rates for the velocity field.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02861v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02861v1,"math.NA, cs.NA, 65N12, 65N30, 76D07"
PROV-AGENT: Unified Provenance for Tracking AI Agent Interactions in   Agentic Workflows,"Renan Souza, Amal Gueroudji, Stephen DeWitt, Daniel Rosendo, Tirthankar Ghosal, Robert Ross, Prasanna Balaprakash, Rafael Ferreira da Silva","Large Language Models (LLMs) and other foundation models are increasingly used as the core of AI agents. In agentic workflows, these agents plan tasks, interact with humans and peers, and influence scientific outcomes across federated and heterogeneous environments. However, agents can hallucinate or reason incorrectly, propagating errors when one agent's output becomes another's input. Thus, assuring that agents' actions are transparent, traceable, reproducible, and reliable is critical to assess hallucination risks and mitigate their workflow impacts. While provenance techniques have long supported these principles, existing methods fail to capture and relate agent-centric metadata such as prompts, responses, and decisions with the broader workflow context and downstream outcomes. In this paper, we introduce PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and data observability to integrate agent interactions into end-to-end workflow provenance.

The moderation of these communities involves consequential decisions affecting member safety, yet existing sociotechnical systems provide insufficient support for moderators. Through interviews with experienced moderators from PWUD forums on Reddit, we analyse the unique nature of this work. We argue that this work constitutes a distinct form of public health intervention characterised by three moderation challenges: the need for specialised, expert risk assessment; time-critical crisis response; and the navigation of a structural conflict between platform policies and community safety goals. We demonstrate how current moderation systems are insufficient in supporting PWUD communities. For example, policies minimising platforms' legal exposure to illicit activities can inadvertently push moderators to implement restrictive rules to protect community's existence, which can limit such a vulnerable group's ability to share potentially life-saving resources online. We conclude by identifying two necessary shifts in sociotechnical design to support moderators' work: first, moving to automated tools that support human sensemaking in contexts with competing interests; and second, shifting from systems that require moderators to perform low-level rule programming to those that enable high-level, example-based instruction.

Alkayas, Anup Teejo Mathew, Federico Renda, Thomas George Thuruthel","Wearable assistive devices are increasingly becoming softer. Modelling their interface with human tissue is necessary to capture transmission of dynamic assistance. However, their nonlinear and compliant nature makes both physical modeling and embedded sensing challenging. In this paper, we develop a image-based, learning-based framework to estimate distributed contact forces for a finger-exosuit system. We used the SoRoSim toolbox to generate a diverse dataset of exosuit geometries and actuation scenarios for training. The method accurately estimated interaction forces across multiple contact locations from low-resolution grayscale images, was able to generalize to unseen shapes and actuation levels, and remained robust under visual noise and contrast variations. We integrated the model into a feedback controller, and found that the vision-based estimator functions as a surrogate force sensor for closed-loop control. This approach could be used as a non-intrusive alternative for real-time force estimation for exosuits.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02870v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02870v1,cs.RO
Evaluation and Analysis of Deep Neural Transformers and Convolutional   Neural Networks on Modern Remote Sensing Datasets,"J. Alex Hurt, Trevor M. Bajkowski, Grant J. Scott, Curt H. Davis","In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers, we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such, it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper, we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity. Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction methodologies and detection algorithms.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02871v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02871v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG"
Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks,"Giovanni Cherubin, Andrew Paverd","Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (""highlights"") from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better than those of a standard RAG pipeline.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02872v1,"cs.CL, cs.LG"
Tunable Leg Stiffness in a Monopedal Hopper for Energy-Efficient   Vertical Hopping Across Varying Ground Profiles,"Rongqian Chen, Jun Kwon, Kefan Wu, Wei-Hsi Chen","We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting leg stiffness.",2025-08-04,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02873v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02873v2,"cs.RO, cs.SY, eess.SY"

We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence. Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation.

A fluid--peridynamic structure model of deformation and damage of   microchannels,"Ziyu Wang, Ivan C. Christov","Soft-walled microchannels arise in many applications, ranging from organ-on-a-chip platforms to soft-robotic actuators. However, despite extensive research on their static and dynamic response, the potential failure of these devices has not been addressed. To this end, we explore fluid--structure interaction in microchannels whose compliant top wall is governed by a nonlocal mechanical theory capable of simulating both deformation and material failure. We develop a one-dimensional model by coupling viscous flow under the lubrication approximation to a state-based peridynamic formulation of an Euler--Bernoulli beam. The peridynamic formulation enables the wall to be modeled as a genuinely nonlocal beam, and the integral form of its equation of motion remains valid whether the deformation field is smooth or contains discontinuities. Through the proposed computational model, we explore the steady and time-dependent behaviors of this fluid--peridynamic structure interaction. We rationalize the wave and damping dynamics observed in the simulations through a dispersion (linearized) analysis of the coupled system, finding that, with increasing nonlocal influence, wave propagation exhibits a clear departure from classical behavior, characterized by a gradual suppression of the phase velocity. The main contribution of our study is to outline the potential failure scenarios of the microchannel's soft wall under the hydrodynamic load of the flow. Specifically, we find a dividing curve in the space spanned by the dimensionless Strouhal number (quantifying unsteady inertia of the beam) and the compliance number (quantifying the strength of the fluid--structure coupling) separating scenarios of potential failure during transient conditions from potential failure at the steady load.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02875v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02875v1,"cs.CE, physics.flu-dyn"
CauKer: classification time series foundation models can be pretrained   on synthetic data only,"Shifeng Xie, Vasilii Feofanov, Marius Alonso, Ambroise Odonnat, Jianfeng Zhang, Themis Palpanas, Ievgen Redko","Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters), unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.",2025-08-04,2025-08-06,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02879v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02879v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Evaluation of 3D Counterfactual Brain MRI Generation,"Pengwei Sun, Wei Peng, Lun Yu Li, Yixin Wang, Kilian M. Pohl","Counterfactual generation offers a principled framework for simulating hypothetical changes in medical imaging, with potential applications in understanding disease mechanisms and generating physiologically plausible data. However, generating realistic structural 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical and causal constraints remains challenging due to data scarcity, structural complexity, and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. In this work, we convert six generative models into 3D counterfactual approaches by incorporating an anatomy-guided framework based on a causal graph, in which regional brain volumes serve as direct conditioning inputs. Each model is evaluated with respect to composition, reversibility, realism, effectiveness and minimality on T1-weighted brain MRIs (T1w MRIs) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In addition, we test the generalizability of each model with respect to T1w MRIs of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Our results indicate that anatomically grounded conditioning successfully modifies the targeted anatomical regions; however, it exhibits limitations in preserving non-targeted structures. Beyond laying the groundwork for more interpretable and clinically relevant generative modeling of brain MRIs, this benchmark highlights the need for novel architectures that more accurately capture anatomical interdependencies.",2025-08-04,2025-08-22,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02880v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02880v2,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings,"Austin C. Kozlowski, Callin Dai, Andrei Boutyline","Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a 3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information, despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore, accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding unintended consequences when steering features.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10003v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Optimizing Preventive and Reactive Defense Resource Allocation with   Uncertain Sensor Signals,"Faezeh Shojaeighadikolaei, Shouhuai Xu, Keith Paarporn","Cyber attacks continue to be a cause of concern despite advances in cyber defense techniques. Although cyber attacks cannot be fully prevented, standard decision-making frameworks typically focus on how to prevent them from succeeding, without considering the cost of cleaning up the damages incurred by successful attacks. This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation problem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its investment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks, and reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes. This encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the observation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this uncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate how the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment in the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be achieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive resources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with higher sensor quality. We also show that the defender's performance improvement, relative to a baseline of no sensors employed, is maximal when the attacker can only achieve low attack success probabilities.",2025-08-04,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02881v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02881v2,"eess.SY, cs.CR, cs.GT, cs.SY"
Neural Networks with Orthogonal Jacobian,"Alex Massucco, Davide Murari, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb","Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures, allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models. In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere. Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02882v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02882v1,"cs.LG, cs.NA, math.NA"
"Merge-based syntax is mediated by distinct neurocognitive mechanisms: A   clustering analysis of comprehension abilities in 84,000 individuals with   language deficits across nine languages","Elliot Murphy, Rohan Venkatesh, Edward Khokhlovich, Andrey Vyshedskiy","In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax, 'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g., 'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase). This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step. From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions (e.g., ""eat apples""); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns (""red boat""); and (3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions (""laptop behind the sofa""). Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of various types of Merge-based objects.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02885v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02885v1,cs.CL
Coherent Multimodal Reasoning with Iterative Self-Evaluation for   Vision-Language Models,"Wenjie Luo, Ruocheng Li, Shanshan Zhu, Julian Perry","Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step, cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of ""deliberative thinking."" They tend to rely on superficial associations rather than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries, generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning (MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning scenarios.

Optimal control driven functional electrical stimulation: A scoping   review,"Kevin Co, Mickaël Begon, François Bailly, Florent Moissenet","Introduction: Rehabilitation after a neurological impairment can be supported by functional electrical stimulation (FES). However, FES is limited by early muscle fatigue, slowing down the recovery progress. The use of optimal control to reduce overstimulation and improve motion precision is gaining interest. This review aims to map the current literature state meanwhile clarifying the best practices, identifying persistent challenges, and outlining directions for future research. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a search was conducted up to February 2024 using the combined keywords ""FES"", ""optimal control"" or ""fatigue"" across five databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Citation Index). Inclusion criteria included the use of optimal control with FES for healthy individuals and those with neuromuscular disorders. Results: Among the 44 included studies, half were in silico and half in vivo, involving 87 participants, predominantly healthy young men. Twelve different motor tasks were investigated, with a focus on single joint lower limb movements. These studies principally used simple FES models, modulating pulse width or intensity to track joint angle. Conclusions: Optimal control-driven FES can deliver precise motions and reduce fatigue. Yet clinical adoption is slowed down by the lack of consensus about modelling, inconvenient model identification protocol and limited validation. Additional barriers include insufficient open-science practices, computational performance reporting and the availability of customizable commercial hardware. Comparative FES model studies and longitudinal trials with large cohorts, among other efforts, are required to improve the technology readiness level.

Seemingly Simple Planning Problems are Computationally Challenging: The   Countdown Game,"Michael Katz, Harsha Kokel, Sarath Sreedharan","There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on instances generated using our procedure.

RDDPM: Robust Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Unsupervised   Anomaly Segmentation,"Mehrdad Moradi, Kamran Paynabar","Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\% higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets.

Global Optimality in Multi-Flyby Asteroid Trajectory Optimization:   Theory and Application Techniques,"Zhong Zhang, Xiang Guo, Di Wu, Hexi Baoyin, Junfeng Li, Francesco Topputo","Designing optimal trajectories for multi-flyby asteroid missions is scientifically critical but technically challenging due to nonlinear dynamics, intermediate constraints, and numerous local optima. This paper establishes a method that approaches global optimality for multi-flyby trajectory optimization under a given sequence. The original optimal control problem with interior-point equality constraints is transformed into a multi-stage decision formulation. This reformulation enables direct application of dynamic programming in lower dimensions, and follows Bellman's principle of optimality. Moreover, the method provides a quantifiable bound on global optima errors introduced by discretization and approximation assumptions, thus ensuring a measure of confidence in the obtained solution. The method accommodates both impulsive and low-thrust maneuver schemes in rendezvous and flyby scenarios. Several computational techniques are introduced to enhance efficiency, including a specialized solution for bi-impulse cases and an adaptive step refinement strategy. The proposed method is validated through three problems: 1) an impulsive variant of the fourth Global Trajectory Optimization competition problem (GTOC4), 2) the GTOC11 problem, and 3) the original low-thrust GTOC4 problem. Each case demonstrates improvements in fuel consumption over the best-known trajectories. These results give evidence of the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method in global trajectory optimization.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02904v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02904v1,"math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY"
How Would It Sound? Material-Controlled Multimodal Acoustic Profile   Generation for Indoor Scenes,"Mahnoor Fatima Saad, Ziad Al-Halah","How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response (RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs, outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02905v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02905v1,"cs.CV, cs.SD, eess.AS"
"Modeling and Simulation of an Active Car Suspension with a Robust LQR   Controller under Road Disturbance, Parameter Uncertainty and White Noise",Mehmet Karahan,"Vehicle suspension is important for passengers to travel comfortably and to be less exposed to effects such as vibration and shock. A good suspension system increases the road holding of vehicles, allows them to take turns safely, and reduces the risk of traffic accidents. A passive suspension system is the most widely used suspension system in vehicles due to its simple structure and low cost. Passive suspension systems do not have an actuator and therefore do not have a controller. Active suspension systems have an actuator and a controller. Although their structures are more complex and costly, they are safer. PID controller is widely used in active suspension systems due to its simple structure, reasonable cost, and easy adjustment of coefficients. In this study, a more robust LQR-controlled active suspension was designed than a passive suspension and a PID-controlled active suspension. Robustness analyses were performed for passive suspension, PID-controlled active suspension, and LQR-controlled active suspension. Suspension travel, sprung mass acceleration, and sprung mass motion simulations were performed for all three suspensions under road disturbance, under simultaneous road disturbance and parameter uncertainty and under road disturbance with white noise. A comparative analysis was performed by obtaining the rise time, overshoot, and settling time data of the suspensions under different conditions. It was observed that the LQR-controlled active suspension showed the fastest rise time, the least overshoot and had the shortest settling time. In this case, it was proven that the LQRcontrolled active suspension provided a more comfortable and safe ride compared to the other two suspension systems.",2025-08-04,2025-08-11,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02906v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02906v3,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Clus-UCB: A Near-Optimal Algorithm for Clustered Bandits,"Aakash Gore, Prasanna Chaporkar","We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori, the arm means are unknown. We derive an asymptotic lower bound on the regret that improves upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically. Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other wellknown algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning some possible future research.",2025-08-04,2025-08-19,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02909v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02909v2,cs.LG
Neural Approximators for Low-Thrust Trajectory Transfer Cost and   Reachability,"Zhong Zhang, Francesco Topputo","In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02911v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02911v1,"cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.OC"
Engineered over Emergent Communication in MARL for Scalable and   Sample-Efficient Cooperative Task Allocation in a Partially Observable Grid,"Brennen A.

For the learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable conditions.

Enhancing Japanese Large Language Models with Reasoning Vectors,"Carolina Minami Oguchi, Leo Wei, Koyo Kobayashi, Hsin-Tai Wu, Dipak Ghosal","Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their performance.

Following Route Instructions using Large Vision-Language Models: A   Comparison between Low-level and Panoramic Action Spaces,"Vebjørn Haug Kåsene, Pierre Lison","Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as ""turn left"" or ""move forward""), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind models specifically designed for this task.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02917v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02917v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.RO"
Decomposition of Symmetrical Classes of Central Configurations,"Marcelo P. Santos, Leon D. da Silva","We study central configurations when the set of positions is symmetric. We use a theorem from representation theory of finite groups to explore the symmetry properties of equations for central configurations. This approach simplifies equations for central configurations by considering arbitrary numbers of bodies, symmetry groups, and dimensions. We discuss how to use this theorem to obtain a more refined decomposition of the equations than that given before. The decomposition presented here uses the symmetry-adapted basis method. As an application, we give a complete description of the existence and which masses are possible for central configurations of two nested regular tetrahedrons, two nested regular octahedrons, and two nested regular cubes. To do this, we employ some methods of rational parameterizations and isolation of zeros of multivariate polynomials. The decomposition obtained allows symbolic calculations to be used to study the expressions. This way, we summarize previous discussions and extend them by completing the analysis on the cube case, for both the inverse and direct problems.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02918v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02918v1,"math.DS, cs.SC, math.RT"
Context-aware Risk Assessment and Its Application in Autonomous Driving,"Boyang Tian, Weisong Shi","Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation, and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a 17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6 ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02919v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02919v1,cs.RO
A Comparative Study of Optimal Control and Neural Networks in Asteroid   Rendezvous Mission Analysis,"Zhong Zhang, Niccolò Michelotti, Gonçalo Oliveira Pinho, Francesco Topputo","This paper presents a comparative study of the applicability and accuracy of optimal control methods and neural network-based estimators in the context of porkchop plots for preliminary asteroid rendezvous mission design. The scenario considered involves a deep-space CubeSat equipped with a low-thrust engine, departing from Earth and rendezvousing with a near-Earth asteroid within a three-year launch window. A low-thrust trajectory optimization model is formulated, incorporating variable specific impulse, maximum thrust, and path constraints. The optimal control problem is efficiently solved using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) combined with a solution continuation strategy. The neural network framework consists of two models: one predicts the minimum fuel consumption ($\Delta v$), while the other estimates the minimum flight time ($\Delta t$) which is used to assess transfer feasibility. Case results demonstrate that, in simplified scenarios without path constraints, the neural network approach achieves low relative errors across most of the design space and successfully captures the main structural features of the porkchop plots. In cases where the SCP-based continuation method fails due to the presence of multiple local optima, the neural network still provides smooth and globally consistent predictions, significantly improving the efficiency of early-stage asteroid candidate screening. However, the deformation of the feasible region caused by path constraints leads to noticeable discrepancies in certain boundary regions, thereby limiting the applicability of the network in detailed mission design phases. Overall, the integration of neural networks with porkchop plot analysis offers a effective decision-making tool for mission designers and planetary scientists, with significant potential for engineering applications.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02920v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02920v1,"math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY"
PentestJudge: Judging Agent Behavior Against Operational Requirements,"Shane Caldwell, Max Harley, Michael Kouremetis, Vincent Abruzzo, Will Pearce","We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model (LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft. LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models, suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be confidently used in sensitive production environments.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02921v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02921v1,"cs.AI, cs.CR"
How Diffusion Prior Landscapes Shape the Posterior in Blind   Deconvolution,"Minh-Hai Nguyen, Edouard Pauwels, Pierre Weiss","The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second, the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions. However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape. We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and optimization techniques.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02923v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02923v1,cs.CV

In such domains, acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static, benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation, complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and surfaces disagreement.

Infrared Object Detection with Ultra Small ConvNets: Is ImageNet   Pretraining Still Useful?,"Srikanth Muralidharan, Heitor R.

While for normal size models, pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working conditions are different.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02927v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02927v1,cs.CV

The proposed NSFD discretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential qualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are often compromised by standard finite difference methods.

In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong, cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight, surface-specific ""expert"" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.

Model-agnostic Meta-learning for Adaptive Gait Phase and Terrain   Geometry Estimation with Wearable Soft Sensors,"Zenan Zhu, Wenxi Chen, Pei-Chun Kao, Janelle Clark, Lily Behnke, Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio, Holly Yanco, Yan Gu","This letter presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based framework for simultaneous and accurate estimation of human gait phase and terrain geometry using a small set of fabric-based wearable soft sensors, with efficient adaptation to unseen subjects and strong generalization across different subjects and terrains. Compared to rigid alternatives such as inertial measurement units, fabric-based soft sensors improve comfort but introduce nonlinearities due to hysteresis, placement error, and fabric deformation. Moreover, inter-subject and inter-terrain variability, coupled with limited calibration data in real-world deployments, further complicate accurate estimation. To address these challenges, the proposed framework integrates MAML into a deep learning architecture to learn a generalizable model initialization that captures subject- and terrain-invariant structure. This initialization enables efficient adaptation (i.e., adaptation with only a small amount of calibration data and a few fine-tuning steps) to new users, while maintaining strong generalization (i.e., high estimation accuracy across subjects and terrains).

In our work, we conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve training efficiency.

The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear, transparent, and physically plausible.

Documenting Patterns of Exoticism of Marginalized Populations within   Text-to-Image Generators,"Sourojit Ghosh, Sanjana Gautam, Pranav Venkit, Avijit Ghosh","A significant majority of AI fairness research studying the harmful outcomes of GAI tools have overlooked non-Western communities and contexts, necessitating a stronger coverage in this vein. We extend our previous work on exoticism (Ghosh et al., 2024) of 'Global South' countries from across the world, as depicted by GAI tools. We analyze generated images of individuals from 13 countries -- India, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Egypt, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Sudan, Libya, Venezuela, Colombia, Indonesia, Honduras, and Mexico -- performing everyday activities (such as being at home, going to work, getting groceries, etc.), as opposed to images for the same activities being performed by persons from 3 'Global North' countries -- USA, UK, Australia. While outputs for 'Global North' demonstrate a difference across images and people clad in activity-appropriate attire, individuals from 'Global South' countries are depicted in similar attire irrespective of the performed activity, indicative of a pattern of exoticism where attire or other cultural features are overamplified at the cost of accuracy. We further show qualitatively-analyzed case studies that demonstrate how exoticism is not simply performed upon 'Global South' countries but also upon marginalized populations even in Western contexts, as we observe a similar exoticization of Indigenous populations in the 'Global North', and doubly upon marginalized populations within 'Global South' countries. We document implications for harm-aware usage patterns of such tools, and steps towards designing better GAI tools through community-centered endeavors.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02937v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02937v1,cs.CY
Refine-IQA: Multi-Stage Reinforcement Finetuning for Perceptual Image   Quality Assessment,"Ziheng Jia, Jiaying Qian, Zicheng Zhang, Zijian Chen, Xiongkuo Min","Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training. Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the ""think"" process, leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907 locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability difference reward involved strategy for ""think"" process supervision. The resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust ""think"" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.",2025-08-04,2025-08-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03763v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03763v2,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
LMDG: Advancing Lateral Movement Detection Through High-Fidelity Dataset   Generation,"Anas Mabrouk, Mohamed Hatem, Mohammad Mamun, Sherif Saad","Lateral Movement (LM) attacks continue to pose a significant threat to enterprise security, enabling adversaries to stealthily compromise critical assets. However, the development and evaluation of LM detection systems are impeded by the absence of realistic, well-labeled datasets. To address this gap, we propose LMDG, a reproducible and extensible framework for generating high-fidelity LM datasets. LMDG automates benign activity generation, multi-stage attack execution, and comprehensive labeling of system and network logs, dramatically reducing manual effort and enabling scalable dataset creation. A central contribution of LMDG is Process Tree Labeling, a novel agent-based technique that traces all malicious activity back to its origin with high precision. Unlike prior methods such as Injection Timing or Behavioral Profiling, Process Tree Labeling enables accurate, step-wise labeling of malicious log entries, correlating each with a specific attack step and MITRE ATT\&CK TTPs. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to support fine-grained labeling of multi-step attacks, providing critical context for detection models such as attack path reconstruction. We used LMDG to generate a 25-day dataset within a 25-VM enterprise environment containing 22 user accounts. The dataset includes 944 GB of host and network logs and embeds 35 multi-stage LM attacks, with malicious events comprising less than 1% of total activity, reflecting a realistic benign-to-malicious ratio for evaluating detection systems. LMDG-generated datasets improve upon existing ones by offering diverse LM attacks, up-to-date attack patterns, longer attack timeframes, comprehensive data sources, realistic network architectures, and more accurate labeling.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02942v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02942v1,cs.CR
A Non-leveled and Reliable Approximate FHE Framework through Binarized   Polynomial Rings,"Baigang Chen, Dongfang Zhao","Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables secure computation on encrypted data, safeguarding user privacy in domains such as cloud computing, healthcare, and finance. Among fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes, CKKS is notable for supporting approximate arithmetic over complex numbers, a key requirement for machine-learning and numerical workloads. However, CKKS incurs rapid noise growth, complex parameter tuning, and relies on costly modulus switching. We propose a binary variant of CKKS that operates entirely over binary-coefficient polynomial rings and replaces rescaling with a lightweight bootstrapping mechanism. To mitigate additional bit-flip errors introduced by binary encoding, we integrate BCH error-correcting codes for robust decryption. Our open-source implementation, built on the HElib library, preserves the core algebraic structure of CKKS while introducing binary-coefficient encoding, enabling efficient evaluation in small ring dimensions and unbounded-depth computation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the framework's practicality and scalability across a range of settings.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02943v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02943v1,cs.CR

Unlike prior methods that emphasize lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02944v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02944v1,cs.CV
LLM-based IR-system for Bank Supervisors,Ilias Aarab,"Bank supervisors face the complex task of ensuring that new measures are consistently aligned with historical precedents. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of 0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92.

In recent years, AI-based diagnostic systems operating on respiratory sounds, have demonstrated success in respiratory disease detection. These systems represent a crucial advancement in early and accessible diagnosis which is essential for timely treatment. However, label and data scarcity remain key challenges, especially for conditions beyond COVID-19, limiting diagnostic performance and reliable evaluation. In this paper, we propose CoughViT, a novel pre-training framework for learning general-purpose cough sound representations, to enhance diagnostic performance in tasks with limited data. To address label scarcity, we employ masked data modelling to train a feature encoder in a self-supervised learning manner. We evaluate our approach against other pre-training strategies on three diagnostically important cough classification tasks.

Current portable air filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to aerosols.

However, current methods are limited by their dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data.

However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo, LLaVA Med, RadFM) models.

This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in real-time.

A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator.

In this work, we propose AMD-Mamba, a novel multi-modal framework for AMD prognosis, and further develop a new AMD biomarker. This framework integrates color fundus images with genetic variants and socio-demographic variables. At its core, AMD-Mamba introduces an innovative metric learning strategy that leverages AMD severity scale score as prior knowledge. This strategy allows the model to learn richer feature representations by aligning learned features with clinical phenotypes, thereby improving the capability of conventional prognosis methods in capturing disease progression patterns. In addition, unlike existing models that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local information, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and simultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular changes. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale fusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different resolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818 color fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic variables from 2,741 subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed biomarker is one of the most significant biomarkers for the progression of AMD.

A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Mobility Control of gNBs in   Dynamic Radio Access Networks,"Pedro Duarte, André Coelho, Manuel Ricardo","The increasing complexity of wireless environments, characterized by user mobility and dynamic obstructions, poses challenges for the maintenance of Line-of-Sight (LoS) connectivity. Mobile base stations (gNBs) stand as a promising solution by physically relocating to restore or sustain LoS, thereby necessitating the development of intelligent algorithms for autonomous movement control.   As part of the CONVERGE research project, which is developing an experimental chamber to integrate computer vision (CV) into mobile networks and enhance Quality of Service (QoS) in dynamic wireless environments, this paper presents two key contributions. First, we introduce the CONVERGE Chamber Simulator (CC-SIM), a 3D simulation environment for developing, training, and validating mobility control algorithms for mobile gNBs. CC-SIM models user and obstacle mobility, visual occlusion, and Radio Frequency (RF) propagation behavior. It supports both offline reinforcement learning and real-time testing through tight integration with a standalone 5G system via the OpenAirInterface (OAI) RF simulator, enabling validation under realistic network conditions.   Second, leveraging CC-SIM, we develop a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that learns to reposition the gNB proactively in response to dynamic environmental changes. Experiments across three representative use cases show that the trained agent significantly reduces LoS blockage time - by up to 42% - when compared to static deployments.

Injecting Measurement Information Yields a Fast and Noise-Robust   Diffusion-Based Inverse Problem Solver,"Jonathan Patsenker, Henry Li, Myeongseob Ko, Ruoxi Jia, Yuval Kluger","Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior and iterative sampling algorithm.

However, this does not consider information from the measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler, resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver.

Towards Robust Image Denoising with Scale Equivariance,"Dawei Zhang, Xiaojie Guo","Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations. Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM) and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between signal and feature paths.

Quantum Hamiltonian Descent based Augmented Lagrangian Method for   Constrained Nonconvex Nonlinear Optimization,"Mingze Li, Lei Fan, Zhu Han","Nonlinear programming (NLP) plays a critical role in domains such as power energy systems, chemical engineering, communication networks, and financial engineering. However, solving large-scale, nonconvex NLP problems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of the solution landscape and the presence of nonlinear nonconvex constraints. In this paper, we develop a Quantum Hamiltonian Descent based Augmented Lagrange Method (QHD-ALM) framework to address largescale, constrained nonconvex NLP problems. The augmented Lagrange method (ALM) can convert a constrained NLP to an unconstrained NLP, which can be solved by using Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD). To run the QHD on a classical machine, we propose to use the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm as the engine to simulate the dynamic process. We apply our algorithm to a Power-to-Hydrogen System, and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02969v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02969v1,"math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Diffusion Models with Adaptive Negative Sampling Without External   Resources,"Alakh Desai, Nuno Vasconcelos","Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality. Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique, applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the other methods.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02973v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02973v1,cs.CV

Physics-informed Neural Time Fields for Prehensile Object Manipulation,"Hanwen Ren, Ruiqi Ni, Ahmed H. Qureshi","Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks. Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the robot's grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance in planning time, trajectory length, and success rates.

Vision Mamba adapts the SSM approach for computer vision tasks, achieving lower latency and memory consumption than traditional transformer models. However, deploying Vision Mamba on edge devices is challenging due to its sequential scan operations, which hinder GPU efficiency.

Unified Tool Integration for LLMs: A Protocol-Agnostic Approach to   Function Calling,"Peng Ding, Rick Stevens","The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols, manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show 60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing function calling standards.

Backbone colouring of chordal graphs,"Júlio Araújo, Nicolas Nisse, Lucas Picasarri-Arrieta","A proper $k$-colouring of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a function $c: V(G)\to \{1,\ldots,k\}$ such that $c(u)\neq c(v)$ for every edge $uv\in E(G)$. The chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is the minimum $k$ such that there exists a proper $k$-colouring of $G$. Given a spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$, a $q$-backbone $k$-colouring of $(G,H)$ is a proper $k$-colouring $c$ of $G$ such that $\lvert c(u)-c(v)\rvert \ge q$ for every edge $uv\in E(H)$. The $q$-backbone chromatic number ${\rm BBC}_q(G,H)$ is the smallest $k$ for which there exists a $q$-backbone $k$-colouring of $(G,H)$. In their seminal paper, Broersma et al.~\cite{BFGW07} ask whether, for any chordal graph $G$ and any spanning forest $H$ of $G$, we have that ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\leq \chi(G)+O(1)$.   In this work, we first show that this is true as long as $H$ is bipartite and $G$ is an interval graph in which each vertex belongs to at most two maximal cliques. We then show that this does not extend to bipartite graphs as backbone by exhibiting a family of chordal graphs $G$ with spanning bipartite subgraphs $H$ satisfying ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\geq \frac{5\chi(G)}{3}$. Then, we show that if $G$ is chordal and $H$ has bounded maximum average degree (in particular, if $H$ is a forest), then ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\leq \chi(G)+O(\sqrt{\chi(G)})$. We finally show that ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\leq \frac{3}{2}\chi(G)+O(1)$ holds whenever $G$ is chordal and $H$ is $C_4$-free.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02980v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02980v1,"math.CO, cs.DM"

Multimodal Human-Intent Modeling for Contextual Robot-to-Human Handovers   of Arbitrary Objects,"Lucas Chen, Guna Avula, Hanwen Ren, Zixing Wang, Ahmed H. Qureshi","Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences. We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences.

Estimation of Aerodynamics Forces in Dynamic Morphing Wing Flight,"Bibek Gupta, Mintae Kim, Albert Park, Eric Sihite, Koushil Sreenath, Alireza Ramezani","Accurate estimation of aerodynamic forces is essential for advancing the control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots with dynamic morphing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate two distinct methodologies for force estimation on Aerobat, a bio-inspired flapping-wing platform designed to emulate the inertial and aerodynamic behaviors observed in bat flight. Our goal is to quantify aerodynamic force contributions during tethered flight, a crucial step toward closed-loop flight control. The first method is a physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics that leverages the concept of conjugate momentum to infer external aerodynamic forces acting on the robot. This observer builds on the system's reduced-order dynamic model and utilizes real-time sensor data to estimate forces without requiring training data. The second method employs a neural network-based regression model, specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to learn a mapping from joint kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters to aerodynamic force outputs. We evaluate both estimators using a 6-axis load cell in a high-frequency data acquisition setup that enables fine-grained force measurements during periodic wingbeats. The conjugate momentum observer and the regression model demonstrate strong agreement across three force components (Fx, Fy, Fz).",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02984v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02984v1,cs.RO
Chromatic discrepancy of locally $s$-colourable graphs,"Timothée Corsini, Lucas Picasarri-Arrieta, Théo Pierron, François Pirot, Eileen Robinson","The chromatic discrepancy of a graph $G$, denoted $\phi(G)$, is the least over all proper colourings $\sigma$ of $G$ of the greatest difference between the number of colours $|\sigma(V(H))|$ spanned by an induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ and its chromatic number $\chi(H)$. We prove that the chromatic discrepancy of a triangle-free graph $G$ is at least $\chi(G)-2$. This is best possible and positively answers a question raised by Aravind, Kalyanasundaram, Sandeep, and Sivadasan.   More generally, we say that a graph $G$ is locally $s$-colourable if the closed neighbourhood of any vertex $v\in V(G)$ is properly $s$-colourable; in particular, a triangle-free graph is locally $2$-colourable. We conjecture that every locally $s$-colourable graph $G$ satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G)-s$, and show that this would be almost best possible. We prove the conjecture when $\chi(G) \le 11s/6$, and as a partial result towards the general case, we prove that every locally $s$-colourable graph $G$ satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G) - s\ln \chi(G)$.   If the conjecture holds, it implies in particular, for every integer $\ell\geq 2$, that any graph $G$ without any copy of $C_{\ell+1}$, the cycle of length $\ell+1$, satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G) - \ell$. When $\ell \ge 3$ and $G\neq K_\ell$, we conjecture that we actually have $\phi(G)\ge \chi(G) - \ell + 1$, and prove it in the special case $\ell = 3$ or $\chi(G) \le 5\ell/3$. In general, we further obtain that every $C_{\ell+1}$-free graph $G$ satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G) - O_{\ell}(\ln \ln \chi(G))$. We do so by determining an almost tight bound on the chromatic number of balls of radius at most $\ell/2$ in $G$, which could be of independent interest.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02985v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02985v1,"math.CO, cs.DM"
Adversarial Attention Perturbations for Large Object Detection   Transformers,"Zachary Yahn, Selim Furkan Tekin, Fatih Ilhan, Sihao Hu, Tiansheng Huang, Yichang Xu, Margaret Loper, Ling Liu","Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks, increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second, AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to 83% with superior speed and imperceptibility.

GACL: Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning with Active Task and   Performance Monitoring,"Linji Wang, Zifan Xu, Peter Stone, Xuesu Xiao","Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning, a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks.

Rather than relying solely on traditional off-chip DRAM and on-chip SRAM, we envisage memory systems equipped with additional types of memory whose performance trade-offs benefit workloads through non-hierarchical optimization. We propose two new memory classes deserving explicit OS support: long-term RAM (LtRAM) optimized for read-intensive data with long lifetimes, and short-term RAM (StRAM) designed for transient, frequently-accessed data with short lifetimes.

It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while reducing communication overhead by over 86%.

This ""agent-as-a-judge"" approach leverages the reasoning and perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline future research directions.

We formalize this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical properties.

Distributed Source Coding for Compressing Vector-Linear Functions,"Xuan Guang, Xiufang Sun, Ruze Zhang","Inspired by mobile satellite communication systems and the important and prevalent applications of computational tasks, we consider a distributed source coding model for compressing vector-linear functions, which consists of multiple sources, multiple encoders and a decoder linked to all the encoders. Each encoder has access to a certain subset of the sources and the decoder is required to compute with zero error a vector-linear function of the source information, which corresponds to a matrix $T$. The connectivity state between the sources and the encoders and the vector-linear function are all arbitrary. In the paper, we are interested in the function-compression capacity to measure the efficiency of using the system. We first present a general lower bound on the function-compression capacity applicable to arbitrary connectivity states and vector-linear functions. Next, we confine to the nontrivial models with only three sources and no more than three encoders, and prove that all the $3\times2$ column-full-rank matrices $T$ can be divided into two types $T_1$ and $T_2$, for which the function-compression capacities are identical if the matrices $T$ have the same type. We explicitly characterize the function-compression capacities for two most nontrivial models associated with $T_2$ by a novel approach of both upper bounding and lower bounding the size of image sets of encoding functions. This shows that the lower bound thus obtained is not always tight. Rather, by completely characterizing their capacities, the lower bound is tight for all the models associated with $T_1$ and all the models associated with $T_2$ except for the two most nontrivial models. We finally apply the obtained results to network function computation and answer the open problem whether the best known upper bound proved by Guang et. al.

MRG-Bench: Evaluating and Exploring the Requirements of Context for   Repository-Level Code Generation,Haiyang Li,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation. However, current evaluation datasets suffer from issues such as the lack of runnable test cases, deviation from the distribution of real-world code, and the ability to evaluate only the Python language. These limitations undermine the credibility of the evaluation results.   To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MRG-Bench} (Multi-language Repository-level Code Generation Benchmark), a novel dataset that provides a more accurate evaluation of LLMs in practical repository-level code generation tasks. MRG-Bench has three main features: (1) practical data sourced from real-world code repositories that align to the practical distribution, (2) multiple programming languages support, including Python, Java, and Go, and (3) project-level runnable test cases to assess the quality of the generated code.   Based on MRG-Bench, we conducted extensive experiments including large language models, long-context models, and RAG-related methods. These evaluation results demonstrate that \textbf{current repository-level code generation techniques suffer from significant performance deficiencies}.

Integrating Upstream Supply Chains into Generation Expansion Planning,"Boyu Yao, Andrey Bernstein, Yury Dvorkin","Rising electricity demand underscores the need for secure and reliable generation expansion planning that accounts for upstream supply chain constraints. Traditional models often overlook limitations in materials, manufacturing capacity, lead times for deployment, and field availability, which can delay availability of planned resources and thus to threaten system reliability. This paper introduces a multi-stage supply chain-constrained generation expansion planning (SC-GEP) model that optimizes long-term investments while capturing material availability, production limits, spatial and temporal constraints, and material reuse from retired assets. A decomposition algorithm efficiently solves the resulting MILP. A Maryland case study shows that supply chain constraints shift technology choices, amplify deployment delays caused by lead times, and prompt earlier investment in shorter lead-time, low-material-intensity options. In the low-demand scenario, supply chain constraints raise investment costs by $1.2 billion. Under high demand, persistent generation and reserve shortfalls emerge, underscoring the need to integrate upstream constraints into long-term planning.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03001v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03001v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Where and How to Enhance: Discovering Bit-Width Contribution for Mixed   Precision Quantization,"Haidong Kang, Lianbo Ma, Guo Yu, Shangce Gao","Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e., bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable (DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance than gradient-based competitors.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03002v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03002v1,cs.LG

Thruster-Enhanced Locomotion: A Decoupled Model Predictive Control with   Learned Contact Residuals,"Chenghao Wang, Alireza Ramezani","Husky Carbon, a robot developed by Northeastern University, serves as a research platform to explore unification of posture manipulation and thrust vectoring. Unlike conventional quadrupeds, its joint actuators and thrusters enable enhanced control authority, facilitating thruster-assisted narrow-path walking. While a unified Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizing both ground reaction forces and thruster forces could theoretically address this control problem, its feasibility is limited by the low torque-control bandwidth of the system's lightweight actuators. To overcome this challenge, we propose a decoupled control architecture: a Raibert-type controller governs legged locomotion using position-based control, while an MPC regulates the thrusters augmented by learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) to account for leg-ground impacts. This separation bypasses the torque-control rate bottleneck while retaining the thruster MPC to explicitly account for leg-ground impact dynamics through learned residuals. We validate this approach through both simulation and hardware experiments, showing that the decoupled control architecture with CRD performs more stable behavior in terms of push recovery and cat-like walking gait compared to the decoupled controller without CRD.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03003v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03003v1,cs.RO

In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when the prompts are adversarially crafted.

Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration via VFM for Domain Generalized   Semantic Segmentation,"Xinhui Li, Xiaojie Guo","Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning, while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability. Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic segmentation task of domain generalization.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03007v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03007v1,cs.CV

Enhancing Long Video Question Answering with Scene-Localized Frame   Grouping,"Xuyi Yang, Wenhao Zhang, Hongbo Jin, Lin Liu, Hongbo Xu, Yongwei Nie, Fei Yu, Fei Ma","Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG. The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos.

To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS, a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.

"When Algorithms Meet Artists: Topic Modeling the AI-Art Debate,   2013-2025","Ariya Mukherjee-Gandhi, Oliver Muellerklein","As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013 to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports, blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent. Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.",2025-08-05,2025-08-26,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03037v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03037v2,"cs.CL, cs.CY, cs.HC"

Tree-of-Reasoning: Towards Complex Medical Diagnosis via Multi-Agent   Reasoning with Evidence Tree,"Qi Peng, Jialin Cui, Jiayuan Xie, Yi Cai, Qing Li","Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios. Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance than existing baseline methods.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03038v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03038v1,cs.AI
Evaluation of GPT-based large language generative AI models as study   aids for the national licensure examination for registered dietitians in   Japan,"Yuta Nagamori, Mikoto Kosai, Yuji Kawai, Haruka Marumo, Misaki Shibuya, Tatsuya Negishi, Masaki Imanishi, Yasumasa Ikeda, Koichiro Tsuchiya, Asuka Sawai, Licht Miyamoto","Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering, including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed. None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and explanations were explicitly provided.

VideoForest: Person-Anchored Hierarchical Reasoning for Cross-Video   Question Answering,"Yiran Meng, Junhong Ye, Wei Zhou, Guanghui Yue, Xudong Mao, Ruomei Wang, Baoquan Zhao","Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and 3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Neural Speech Extraction with Human Feedback,"Malek Itani, Ashton Graves, Sefik Emre Eskimez, Shyamnath Gollakota","We present the first neural target speech extraction (TSE) system that uses human feedback for iterative refinement. Our approach allows users to mark specific segments of the TSE output, generating an edit mask. The refinement system then improves the marked sections while preserving unmarked regions. Since large-scale datasets of human-marked errors are difficult to collect, we generate synthetic datasets using various automated masking functions and train models on each. Evaluations show that models trained with noise power-based masking (in dBFS) and probabilistic thresholding perform best, aligning with human annotations. In a study with 22 participants, users showed a preference for refined outputs over baseline TSE.

Provably Near-Optimal Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning in   Online Settings,"Debamita Ghosh, George K. Atia, Yue Wang","Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions. Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning, demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03768v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03768v1,cs.LG
Urban In-Context Learning: Bridging Pretraining and Inference through   Masked Diffusion for Urban Profiling,"Ruixing Zhang, Bo Wang, Tongyu Zhu, Leilei Sun, Weifeng Lv","Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas; second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning, a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods. Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion modeling.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03042v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03042v1,cs.LG
Aerobatic maneuvers in insect-scale flapping-wing aerial robots via   deep-learned robust tube model predictive control,"Yi-Hsuan Hsiao, Andrea Tagliabue, Owen Matteson, Suhan Kim, Tong Zhao, Jonathan P. How, YuFeng Chen","Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking, saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$ improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11 seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03043v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03043v1,"cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY"
A Novel Multimodal Framework for Early Detection of Alzheimers Disease   Using Deep Learning,"Tatwadarshi P Nagarhalli, Sanket Patil, Vishal Pande, Uday Aswalekar, Prafulla Patil","Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods, typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03046v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03046v1,cs.LG

Low-rankness and Smoothness Meet Subspace: A Unified Tensor   Regularization for Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution,"Jun Zhang, Chao Yi, Mingxi Ma, Chao Wang","Hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR) has emerged as a challenging yet critical problem in remote sensing. Existing approaches primarily focus on regularization techniques that leverage low-rankness and local smoothness priors. Recently, correlated total variation has been introduced for tensor recovery, integrating these priors into a single regularization framework. Direct application to HSI-SR, however, is hindered by the high spectral dimensionality of hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a unified tensor regularizer, called JLRST, which jointly encodes low-rankness and local smoothness priors under a subspace framework. Specifically, we compute the gradients of the clustered coefficient tensors along all three tensor modes to fully exploit spectral correlations and nonlocal similarities in HSI. By enforcing priors on subspace coefficients rather than the entire HR-HSI data, the proposed method achieves improved computational efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to mitigate the bias introduced by the tensor nuclear norm (TNN), we introduce the mode-3 logarithmic TNN to process gradient tensors. An alternating direction method of multipliers with proven convergence is developed to solve the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in HSI-SR.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03049v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03049v1,"math.NA, cs.NA"
Multi-human Interactive Talking Dataset,"Zeyu Zhu, Weijia Wu, Mike Zheng Shou","Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their applicability to realistic multi-human interactions.

SkeNa: Learning to Navigate Unseen Environments Based on Abstract   Hand-Drawn Maps,"Haojun Xu, Jiaqi Xiang, Wu Wei, Jinyu Chen, Linqing Zhong, Linjiang Huang, Hongyu Yang, Si Liu","A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71 indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor (DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105% relatively.

Beyond Surface-Level Detection: Towards Cognitive-Driven Defense Against   Jailbreak Attacks via Meta-Operations Reasoning,"Rui Pu, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Ha, Litian Zhang, Lirong Qiu, Xi Zhang","Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense (CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats, an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03054v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03054v1,cs.AI
Uncertainty-Guided Face Matting for Occlusion-Aware Face Transformation,"Hyebin Cho, Jaehyup Lee","Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However, their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation, we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained video scenarios.

A central problem identified is that the development of AI technologies is far outpacing the creation of adequate legal and ethical guidelines.   The research proposes a ""reference model"" for the development and implementation of autonomous AI systems in corporate management. This model is based on a synthesis of several key components to ensure legitimate and ethical decision-making. The model introduces the concept of ""computational law"" or ""algorithmic law"". This involves creating a separate legal framework for AI systems, with rules and regulations translated into a machine-readable, algorithmic format to avoid the ambiguity of natural language. The paper emphasises the need for a ""dedicated operational context"" for autonomous AI systems, analogous to the ""operational design domain"" for autonomous vehicles. This means creating a specific, clearly defined environment and set of rules within which the AI can operate safely and effectively. The model advocates for training AI systems on controlled, synthetically generated data to ensure fairness and ethical considerations are embedded from the start. Game theory is also proposed as a method for calculating the optimal strategy for the AI to achieve its goals within these ethical and legal constraints.

Such noise may cause models to lose attention on key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines.

I have operationalized this paradigm through three techniques: (1) Hierarchical Narrative, which supports photo-collection exploration at different levels of detail; (2) Parallel Narrative, which provides seamless access to time-synced video comments; and (3) Branching Narrative, which enables immersive navigation of 360{\deg} videos. Together, these techniques demonstrate that AI-powered interactive storytelling can effectively balance user agency with narrative coherence across diverse media formats. My future work will advance this paradigm by enabling more personalized and expressive storytelling experiences for BLV audiences.",2025-08-05,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03061v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03061v2,cs.HC
Lightweight Fault Detection Architecture for NTT on FPGA,"Rourab Paul, Paresh Baidya, Krishnendu Guha","Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms are mathematically secure and resistant to quantum attacks but can still leak sensitive information in hardware implementations due to natural faults or intentional fault injections. The intent fault injection in side-channel attacks reduces the reliability of crypto implementation in future generation network security procesors. In this regard, this research proposes a lightweight, efficient, recomputation-based fault detection module implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). The NTT is primarily composed of memory units and the Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU), a critical and computationally intensive hardware component essential for polynomial multiplication. NTT and polynomial multiplication are fundamental building blocks in many PQC algorithms, including Kyber, NTRU, Ring-LWE, and others. In this paper, we present a fault detection method called : Recomputation with a Modular Offset (REMO) for the logic blocks of the CT-BU using Montgomery Reduction and another method called Memory Rule Checkers for the memory components used within the NTT. The proposed fault detection framework sets a new benchmark by achieving high efficiency with significant low implementation cost. It occupies only 16 slices and a single DSP block, with a power consumption of just 3mW in Artix-7 FPGA. The REMO-based detection mechanism achieves a fault coverage of 87.2% to 100%, adaptable across various word sizes, fault bit counts, and fault injection modes. Similarly, the Memory Rule Checkers demonstrate robust performance, achieving 50.7% to 100% fault detection depending on and the nature of injected faults.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03062v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03062v1,cs.CR
CORE-ReID: Comprehensive Optimization and Refinement through Ensemble   fusion in Domain Adaptation for person re-identification,"Trinh Quoc Nguyen, Oky Dicky Ardiansyah Prima, Katsuyoshi Hotta","This study introduces a novel framework, ""Comprehensive Optimization and Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person Re-identification (CORE-ReID)"", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage, based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels. A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local information within global features is introduced to enhance learning comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision, Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution for the UDA in Person ReID.

Untraceable DeepFakes via Traceable Fingerprint Elimination,"Jiewei Lai, Lan Zhang, Chen Tang, Pengcheng Sun, Xinming Wang, Yunhao Wang","Recent advancements in DeepFakes attribution technologies have significantly enhanced forensic capabilities, enabling the extraction of traces left by generative models (GMs) in images, making DeepFakes traceable back to their source GMs. Meanwhile, several attacks have attempted to evade attribution models (AMs) for exploring their limitations, calling for more robust AMs. However, existing attacks fail to eliminate GMs' traces, thus can be mitigated by defensive measures. In this paper, we identify that untraceable DeepFakes can be achieved through a multiplicative attack, which can fundamentally eliminate GMs' traces, thereby evading AMs even enhanced with defensive measures. We design a universal and black-box attack method that trains an adversarial model solely using real data, applicable for various GMs and agnostic to AMs. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding attack capability and universal applicability of our method, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 97.08\% against 6 advanced AMs on DeepFakes generated by 9 GMs. Even in the presence of defensive mechanisms, our method maintains an ASR exceeding 72.39\%.

Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human data collected by Aria glasses.

SSFMamba: Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency Feature Fusion for 3D   Medical Image Segmentation,"Bo Zhang, Yifan Zhang, Shuo Yan, Yu Bai, Zheng Zhang, Wu Liu, Xiuzhuang Zhou, Wendong Wang","In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba, a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and global cues.

Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including starting and stopping from a standing position.

Achieving Limited Adaptivity for Multinomial Logistic Bandits,"Sukruta Prakash Midigeshi, Tanmay Goyal, Gaurav Sinha","Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However, motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms, respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$ update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$ policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive (and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various practical scenarios.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03072v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03072v1,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
Nexus-INR: Diverse Knowledge-guided Arbitrary-Scale Multimodal Medical   Image Super-Resolution,"Bo Zhang, JianFei Huo, Zheng Zhang, Wufan Wang, Hui Gao, Xiangyang Gong, Wendong Wang","Arbitrary-resolution super-resolution (ARSR) provides crucial flexibility for medical image analysis by adapting to diverse spatial resolutions. However, traditional CNN-based methods are inherently ill-suited for ARSR, as they are typically designed for fixed upsampling factors. While INR-based methods overcome this limitation, they still struggle to effectively process and leverage multi-modal images with varying resolutions and details. In this paper, we propose Nexus-INR, a Diverse Knowledge-guided ARSR framework, which employs varied information and downstream tasks to achieve high-quality, adaptive-resolution medical image super-resolution. Specifically, Nexus-INR contains three key components. A dual-branch encoder with an auxiliary classification task to effectively disentangle shared anatomical structures and modality-specific features; a knowledge distillation module using cross-modal attention that guides low-resolution modality reconstruction with high-resolution reference, enhanced by self-supervised consistency loss; an integrated segmentation module that embeds anatomical semantics to improve both reconstruction quality and downstream segmentation performance.

RobustGS: Unified Boosting of Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting under   Low-Quality Conditions,"Anran Wu, Long Peng, Xin Di, Xueyuan Dai, Chen Wu, Yang Wang, Xueyang Fu, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha","Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward 3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views, enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across various types of degradations.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03077v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03077v1,cs.CV

In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic attributes.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03079v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03079v1,cs.CV
ContractEval: Benchmarking LLMs for Clause-Level Legal Risk   Identification in Commercial Contracts,"Shuang Liu, Zelong Li, Ruoyun Ma, Haiyan Zhao, Mengnan Du","The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15 open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better, though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning (""thinking"") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate ""no related clause"" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are present. This suggests ""laziness"" in thinking or low confidence in extracting relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings.

To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas.

EoH-S: Evolution of Heuristic Set using LLMs for Automated Heuristic   Design,"Fei Liu, Yilu Liu, Qingfu Zhang, Xialiang Tong, Mingxuan Yuan","Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances, often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings. To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances, such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.

Understanding Transformers through the Lens of Pavlovian Conditioning,Mu Qiao,"Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and (3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone, but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over millions of years of evolution.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08289v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08289v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, q-bio.NC"
ADSeeker: A Knowledge-Infused Framework for Anomaly Detection and   Reasoning,"Kai Zhang, Zekai Zhang, Xihe Sun, Jingmeng Nie, Qinghui Chen, Han Hao, Jianyuan Guo, Jinglin Zhang","Automatic vision inspection holds significant importance in industry inspection. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong language understanding capabilities and hold promise for this task, their performance remains significantly inferior to that of human experts. In this context, we identify two key challenges: (i) insufficient integration of anomaly detection (AD) knowledge during pre-training, and (ii) the lack of technically precise and conte-aware language generation for anomaly reasoning. To address these issues, we propose ADSeeker, an anomaly task assistant designed to enhance inspection performance through knowledge-grounded reasoning. ADSeeker leverages a curated visual document knowledge base, SEEK-MVTec&VisA (SEEK-M&V), which we construct to address the limitations of existing resources that rely solely on unstructured text. SEEK-M&V includes semantic-rich descriptions and image-document pairs, enabling more comprehensive anomaly understanding. To effectively retrieve and utilize this knowledge, we introduce the Query Image-Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Q2K RAG) framework. To further enhance the performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD), ADSeeker leverages the Hierarchical Sparse Prompt mechanism and type-level features to efficiently extract anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of limited in industry anomaly detection (IAD) data, we introduce the largest-scale AD dataset, Multi-type Anomaly (MulA), encompassing 72 multi-scale defect types across 26 Categories.

T2UE: Generating Unlearnable Examples from Text Descriptions,"Xingjun Ma, Hanxun Huang, Tianwei Song, Ye Sun, Yifeng Gao, Yu-Gang Jiang","Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples (UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox: users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image (noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning settings.

Coloring 3-Colorable Graphs with Low Threshold Rank,Jun-Ting Hsieh,"We present a new algorithm for finding large independent sets in $3$-colorable graphs with small $1$-sided threshold rank.

This extends and improves upon the result of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari on $1$-sided expanders. Furthermore, an independent work by Buhai, Hua, Steurer, and V\'ari-Kakas shows that it is UG-hard to properly $3$-color more than $(\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon)n$ vertices, thus establishing the tightness of our result.   Our proof is short and simple, relying on the observation that for any distribution over proper $3$-colorings, the correlation across an edge must be large if the marginals of the endpoints are not concentrated on any single color.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention module, coupled with an attention loss.

In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR-LLM), an extensible and lightweight split learning framework for LLMs, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference and fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Our library provides two LLM partition settings, supporting three task types and 18 datasets. In addition, we provide standard modules for implementing and evaluating attacks and defenses. We benchmark 5 attacks and 9 defenses under various Split Learning for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant hyperparameters for real-world applications.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03097v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03097v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI, I.2.11"
Privacy-Aware Decoding: Mitigating Privacy Leakage of Large Language   Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Haoran Wang, Xiongxiao Xu, Baixiang Huang, Kai Shu","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources. However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs. Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy solutions in sensitive domains.

Point2Act: Efficient 3D Distillation of Multimodal LLMs for Zero-Shot   Context-Aware Grasping,"Sang Min Kim, Hyeongjun Heo, Junho Kim, Yonghyeon Lee, Young Min Kim","We propose Point2Act, which directly retrieves the 3D action point relevant for a contextually described task, leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Foundation models opened the possibility for generalist robots that can perform a zero-shot task following natural language descriptions within an unseen environment. While the semantics obtained from large-scale image and language datasets provide contextual understanding in 2D images, the rich yet nuanced features deduce blurry 2D regions and struggle to find precise 3D locations for actions. Our proposed 3D relevancy fields bypass the high-dimensional features and instead efficiently imbue lightweight 2D point-level guidance tailored to the task-specific action. The multi-view aggregation effectively compensates for misalignments due to geometric ambiguities, such as occlusion, or semantic uncertainties inherent in the language descriptions. The output region is highly localized, reasoning fine-grained 3D spatial context that can directly transfer to an explicit position for physical action at the on-the-fly reconstruction of the scene. Our full-stack pipeline, which includes capturing, MLLM querying, 3D reconstruction, and grasp pose extraction, generates spatially grounded responses in under 20 seconds, facilitating practical manipulation tasks.

"AVATAR: Reinforcement Learning to See, Hear, and Reason Over Video","Yogesh Kulkarni, Pooyan Fazli","Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks, outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and +4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03100v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03100v1,cs.CV
Using the NANDA Index Architecture in Practice: An Enterprise   Perspective,"Sichao Wang, Ramesh Raskar, Mahesh Lambe, Pradyumna Chari, Rekha Singhal, Shailja Gupta, Rajesh Ranjan, Ken Huang","The proliferation of autonomous AI agents represents a paradigmatic shift from traditional web architectures toward collaborative intelligent systems requiring sophisticated mechanisms for discovery, authentication, capability verification, and secure collaboration across heterogeneous protocol environments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework addressing the fundamental infrastructure requirements for secure, trustworthy, and interoperable AI agent ecosystems. We introduce the NANDA (Networked AI Agents in a Decentralized Architecture) framework, providing global agent discovery, cryptographically verifiable capability attestation through AgentFacts, and cross-protocol interoperability across Anthropic's Modal Context Protocol (MCP), Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Microsoft's NLWeb, and standard HTTPS communications.

Causal Disentanglement and Cross-Modal Alignment for Enhanced Few-Shot   Learning,"Tianjiao Jiang, Zhen Zhang, Yuhang Liu, Javen Qinfeng Shi","Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining computational efficiency.

HiTeC: Hierarchical Contrastive Learning on Text-Attributed Hypergraph   with Semantic-Aware Augmentation,"Mengting Pan, Fan Li, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenjie Zhang, Xuemin Lin","Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels. However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology, resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap, we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of HiTeC.",2025-08-05,2025-08-10,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03104v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03104v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Accelerating SGDM via Learning Rate and Batch Size Schedules: A   Lyapunov-Based Analysis,"Yuichi Kondo, Hideaki Iiduka","We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules. Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior: while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both (ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than (i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03105v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03105v1,cs.LG

Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to enhance ID-OOD separability.

AgentSME for Simulating Diverse Communication Modes in Smart Education,"Wen-Xi Yang, Tian-Fang Zhao","Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo, Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and inspire smart education models.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03109v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03109v1,cs.AI
Token-Level Precise Attack on RAG: Searching for the Best Alternatives   to Mislead Generation,"Zizhong Li, Haopeng Zhang, Jiawei Zhang","While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation. Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03110v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03110v1,cs.CL
GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance,"Francesco Leonardi, Markus Orsi, Jean-Louis Reymond, Kaspar Riesen","Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting, it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03111v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Cross-lingual Opinions and Emotions Mining in Comparable Documents,"Motaz Saad, David Langlois, Kamel Smaili","Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA) lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera (JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones. The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language pairs.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03112v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03112v1,"cs.CL, I.2.7"

Unlike traditional DNS or static URLs, AdaptiveResolver enables context-aware, real-time selection of communication endpoints based on factors such as geographic location, system load, agent capabilities, and security threats. Agents advertise their Agent Name and context requirements through Agent Fact cards in an Agent Registry/Index. A requesting Agent discovers a Target Agent using the registry. The Requester Agent can then resolve the Target Agent Name to obtain a tailored communication channel to the agent based on actual environmental context between the agents.

Peer Effect Estimation in the Presence of Simultaneous Feedback and   Unobserved Confounders,"Xiaojing Du, Jiuyong Li, Lin Liu, Debo Cheng, Thuc. Le","Estimating peer causal effects within complex real-world networks such as social networks is challenging, primarily due to simultaneous feedback between peers and unobserved confounders. Existing methods either address unobserved confounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback but under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer effect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning framework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an instrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback and unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and high-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to disentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the simultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct valid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on these IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the unobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network augmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as a control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no residual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in capturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances the effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and hidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard regularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect. Empirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09154v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09154v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ME"
Toward a Trustworthy Optimization Modeling Agent via Verifiable   Synthetic Data Generation,"Vinicius Lima, Dzung T. Phan, Jayant Kalagnanam, Dhaval Patel, Nianjun Zhou","We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM) agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations, multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.

H3R: Hybrid Multi-view Correspondence for Generalizable 3D   Reconstruction,"Heng Jia, Linchao Zhu, Na Zhao","Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable 3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\""ucker coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$ faster than existing methods.

Can Large Language Models Identify Materials from Radar Signals?,"Jiangyou Zhu, Hongyu Deng, He Chen","Accurately identifying the material composition of objects is a critical capability for AI robots powered by large language models (LLMs) to perform context-aware manipulation. Radar technologies offer a promising sensing modality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar technologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of various objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained to closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data collection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical applicability. This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material composition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due to the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs have no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we introduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using LLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a physics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar raw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the material's intrinsic characteristics. Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, enabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters. Leveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step reasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material recognition directly from raw radar signals. Preliminary results show that LLMaterial can effectively distinguish among a variety of common materials, highlighting its strong potential for real-world material identification applications.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03120v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03120v1,"eess.SP, cs.ET, cs.RO"
RegMean++: Enhancing Effectiveness and Generalization of Regression Mean   for Model Merging,"The-Hai Nguyen, Dang Huu-Tien, Takeshi Suzuki, Le-Minh Nguyen","Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently, overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness under several types of distribution shifts.

Landsat30-AU: A Vision-Language Dataset for Australian Landsat Imagery,"Sai Ma, Zhuang Li, John A Taylor","Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term, high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components: Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing $196,262$ image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA, comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and boosts VQA accuracy from 0.74 to 0.87.

Safety-Aware Imitation Learning via MPC-Guided Disturbance Injection,"Le Qiu, Yusuf Umut Ciftci, Somil Bansal","Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating improvements in both safety and task performance.

Protecting Small Organizations from AI Bots with Logrip: Hierarchical IP   Hashing,Rama Carl Hoetzlein,"Small organizations, start ups, and self-hosted servers face increasing strain from automated web crawlers and AI bots, whose online presence has increased dramatically in the past few years. Modern bots evade traditional throttling and can degrade server performance through sheer volume even when they are well-behaved. We introduce a novel security approach that leverages data visualization and hierarchical IP hashing to analyze server event logs, distinguishing human users from automated entities based on access patterns. By aggregating IP activity across subnet classes and applying statistical measures, our method detects coordinated bot activity and distributed crawling attacks that conventional tools fail to identify. Using a real world example we estimate that 80 to 95 percent of traffic originates from AI crawlers, underscoring the need for improved filtering mechanisms. Our approach enables small organizations to regulate automated traffic effectively, preserving public access while mitigating performance degradation.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03130v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03130v1,cs.CR
COFFEE: A Shadow-Resilient Real-Time Pose Estimator for Unknown Tumbling   Asteroids using Sparse Neural Networks,"Arion Zimmermann, Soon-Jo Chung, Fred Hadaegh","The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods, such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates, whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03132v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03132v1,"cs.CV, cs.RO"
Filtering and 1/3 Power Law for Optimal Time Discretisation in Numerical   Integration of Stochastic Differential Equations,Igor G. Vladimirov,"This paper is concerned with the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) which govern diffusion processes driven by a standard Wiener process. With the latter being replaced by a sequence of increments at discrete moments of time, we revisit a filtering point of view on the approximate strong solution of the SDE as an estimate of the hidden system state whose conditional probability distribution is updated using a Bayesian approach and Brownian bridges over the intermediate time intervals. For a class of multivariable linear SDEs, where the numerical solution is organised as a Kalman filter, we investigate the fine-grid asymptotic behaviour of terminal and integral mean-square error functionals when the time discretisation is specified by a sufficiently smooth monotonic transformation of a uniform grid. This leads to constrained optimisation problems over the time discretisation profile, and their solutions reveal a 1/3 power law for the asymptotically optimal grid density functions. As a one-dimensional example, the results are illustrated for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03135v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03135v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.OC, math.PR, 65C30, 34K28, 60J60, 60J65, 93E11, 62F15, 65L50, 65K10, 60G15, 60H35"
Distributionally Robust Markov Games with Average Reward,"Zachary Roch, Yue Wang","This paper introduces the formulation of a distributionally robust Markov game (DR-MG) with average rewards, a crucial framework for multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty over extended horizons. Unlike finite-horizon or discounted models, the average-reward criterion naturally captures long-term performance for systems designed for continuous operation, where sustained reliability is paramount. We account for uncertainty in transition kernels, with players aiming to optimize their worst-case average reward. We first establish a connection between the multi-agent and single agent settings, and derive the solvability of the robust Bellman equation under the average-reward formulation. We then rigorously prove the existence of a robust Nash Equilibrium (NE), offering essential theoretical guarantees for system stability. We further develop and analyze an algorithm named robust Nash-Iteration to compute the robust Nash Equilibria among all agents, providing practical tools for identifying optimal strategies in complex, uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments. Finally, we demonstrate the connection between the average-reward NE and the well-studied discounted NEs, showing that the former can be approximated as the discount factor approaches one. Together, these contributions provide a comprehensive theoretical and algorithmic foundation for identifying optimal strategies in complex, uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments, which allow for the future extension of robust average-reward single-agent problems to the multi-agent setting.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03136v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03136v1,cs.MA
Long Story Generation via Knowledge Graph and Literary Theory,"Ge Shi, Kaiyu Huang, Guochen Feng","The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic that are less appealing to human readers.   In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03137v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03137v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Language as Cost: Proactive Hazard Mapping using VLM for Robot   Navigation,"Mintaek Oh, Chan Kim, Seung-Woo Seo, Seong-Woo Kim","Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively anticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters, compared to reactive baseline planners.

RCP-Merging: Merging Long Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific   Models by Considering Reasoning Capability as Prior,"Junyao Yang, Jianwei Wang, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen, Ziqian Zeng","Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability, termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging essential domain-specific weights.

Building on this foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score (PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences, most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans.

"UniEdit-I: Training-free Image Editing for Unified VLM via Iterative   Understanding, Editing and Verifying","Chengyu Bai, Jintao Chen, Xiang Bai, Yilong Chen, Qi She, Ming Lu, Shanghang Zhang","In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced, effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices, the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image. The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps: understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3. The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop. This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence, delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03142v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03142v1,cs.CV

To overcome these limitations, we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts. Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for pixel-level anomaly synthesis.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03143v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03143v1,cs.CV
Inductive transfer learning from regression to classification in ECG   analysis,"Ridma Jayasundara, Ishan Fernando, Adeepa Fernando, Roshan Ragel, Vajira Thambawita, Isuru Nawinne","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for over 30% of global deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Importantly, one-third of these deaths are preventable with timely and accurate diagnosis. The electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive method for recording the electrical activity of the heart, is crucial for diagnosing CVDs. However, privacy concerns surrounding the use of patient ECG data in research have spurred interest in synthetic data, which preserves the statistical properties of real data without compromising patient confidentiality. This study explores the potential of synthetic ECG data for training deep learning models from regression to classification tasks and evaluates the feasibility of transfer learning to enhance classification performance on real ECG data. We experimented with popular deep learning models to predict four key cardiac parameters, namely, Heart Rate (HR), PR interval, QT interval, and QRS complex-using separate regression models. Subsequently, we leveraged these regression models for transfer learning to perform 5-class ECG signal classification. Our experiments systematically investigate whether transfer learning from regression to classification is viable, enabling better utilization of diverse open-access and synthetic ECG datasets.

LORE: Latent Optimization for Precise Semantic Control in Rectified   Flow-based Image Editing,"Liangyang Ouyang, Jiafeng Mao","Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit.

In addition, these approaches commonly target at distinguishing chunked IoT event traffic samples, and they failed at effectively tracking multiple events simultaneously. In this work, we propose WiFinger, a fine-grained multi-IoT event fingerprinting approach against noisy traffic. WiFinger turns the traffic pattern classification task into a subsequence matching problem and introduces novel techniques to account for the high time complexity while maintaining high accuracy.

An Event-based State Estimation Approach for Positive Systems with   Positive Observers,"Bhargavi Chaudhary, Krishanu Nath, Subashish Datta, Indra Narayan Kar","This article addresses the problem of state observer design for continuous-time linear positive networked systems. Considering the bandwidth constraint in the communication network, an event-measurement-based positive observer design is proposed. The physical interpretation of a positive observer differs from that of a general observer. Its primary goal is to ensure that all state estimates remain non-negative at all times. Using output measurements, a law with weighted sampling error is used to determine the sampling sequence between the system and the observer. The observer dynamics are designed using the standard Luenberger structure with the event-based sampled output information, which is updated only when an event occurs. Assuming observability and sufficient conditions for the positivity of the system, the asymptotic stability of the observer dynamics with sampled information is established. Sufficient conditions of stability and positivity are derived using linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the design ensures that the event-based architecture is free from Zeno behavior, ensuring a positive minimum bound on the inter-execution time. In addition, numerical simulations on a three-tank system having variable cross-sections are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed event-based positive observer.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03154v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03154v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Unveiling Location-Specific Price Drivers: A Two-Stage Cluster Analysis   for Interpretable House Price Predictions,"Paul Gümmer, Julian Rosenberger, Mathias Kraus, Patrick Zschech, Nico Hambauer","House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations. Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM), balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable property valuations.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03156v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03156v1,cs.LG
Rethinking Selectivity in State Space Models: A Minimal Predictive   Sufficiency Approach,"Yiyi Wang, Jian'an Zhang, Hongyi Duan, Haoyang Liu, Qingyang Li","State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba, have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations. To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03158v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03158v1,"cs.LG, cs.IT, math.IT"
CoTox: Chain-of-Thought-Based Molecular Toxicity Reasoning and   Prediction,"Jueon Park, Yein Park, Minju Song, Soyon Park, Donghyeon Lee, Seungheun Baek, Jaewoo Kang","Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale. To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO) terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support early-stage drug safety assessment.

ChartCap: Mitigating Hallucination of Dense Chart Captioning,"Junyoung Lim, Jaewoo Ahn, Gunhee Kim","Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03164v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03164v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL"

Overcoming Algorithm Aversion with Transparency: Can Transparent   Predictions Change User Behavior?,"Lasse Bohlen, Sven Kruschel, Julian Rosenberger, Patrick Zschech, Mathias Kraus","Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML) model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions. However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants, we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than expected and was not significant for our sample.

Quantum Spectral Reasoning: A Non-Neural Architecture for Interpretable   Machine Learning,Andrew Kiruluta,"We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods, specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse, physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks.

We begin by deriving the convergence accuracy of the FL model under multiple local updates, enabling a theoretical understanding of how user participation and data volume affect FL learning performance. The resulting joint optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we employ alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to convexify the non-convex constraints, leading to the design of an iterative energy consumption optimization (ECO) algorithm.

While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams. Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry.

Adaptive Sparse Softmax: An Effective and Efficient Softmax Variant,"Qi Lv, Lei Geng, Ziqiang Cao, Min Cao, Sujian Li, Wenjie Li, Guohong Fu","Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the ""target-approach-1"" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class, text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while maintaining classification effectiveness.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03175v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03175v1,cs.LG

Although previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images, which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs' final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.

Our investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard, easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns. Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL) reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.

DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance, where the parameter $\beta$ varies with the development of the training epoch. Wind tunnel testing is performed to collect wall pressures of a two-dimensional rectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 at an angle of attack of zero using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found to forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy. The comparison between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in statistical information, temporal pressure variation, power spectrum density, spatial distribution, and spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found that embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient $\beta$ in the DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure information, in particular, in forecasting high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03183v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03183v1,"physics.flu-dyn, cs.AI, cs.CE"
Principle-Guided Verilog Optimization: IP-Safe Knowledge Transfer via   Local-Cloud Collaboration,"Jing Wang, Zheng Li, Lei Li, Fan He, Liyu Lin, Yao Lai, Yan Li, Xiaoyang Zeng, Yufeng Guo","Recent years have witnessed growing interest in adopting large language models (LLMs) for Register Transfer Level (RTL) code optimization. While powerful cloud-based LLMs offer superior optimization capabilities, they pose unacceptable intellectual property (IP) leakage risks when processing proprietary hardware designs. In this paper, we propose a new scenario where Verilog code must be optimized for specific attributes without leaking sensitive IP information. We introduce the first IP-preserving edge-cloud collaborative framework that leverages the benefits of both paradigms. Our approach employs local small LLMs (e.g., Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B) to perform secure comparative analysis between paired high-quality target designs and novice draft codes, yielding general design principles that summarize key insights for improvements. These principles are then used to query stronger cloud LLMs (e.g., Deepseek-V3) for targeted code improvement, ensuring that only abstracted and IP-safe guidance reaches external services. Our experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves significantly higher optimization success rates compared to baseline methods. For example, combining Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B and Deepseek-V3 achieves a 66.67\% optimization success rate for power utilization, outperforming Deepseek-V3 alone (49.81\%) and even commercial models like GPT-4o (55.81\%). Further investigation of local and cloud LLM combinations reveals that different model pairings exhibit varying strengths for specific optimization objectives, with interesting trends emerging when varying the number of comparative code pairs. Our work establishes a new paradigm for secure hardware design optimization that balances performance gains with IP protection.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05675v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05675v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI"
Monocular Depth Estimation with Global-Aware Discretization and Local   Context Modeling,"Heng Wu, Qian Zhang, Guixu Zhang","Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins and provides structural guidance for depth regression.

Fitness and Overfitness: Implicit Regularization in Evolutionary   Dynamics,"Hagai Rappeport, Mor Nitzan","A common assumption in evolutionary thought is that adaptation drives an increase in biological complexity. However, the rules governing evolution of complexity appear more nuanced. Evolution is deeply connected to learning, where complexity is much better understood, with established results on optimal complexity appropriate for a given learning task. In this work, we suggest a mathematical framework for studying the relationship between evolved organismal complexity and enviroenmntal complexity by leveraging a mathematical isomorphism between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory. Namely, between the replicator equation and sequential Bayesian learning, with evolving types corresponding to competing hypotheses and fitness in a given environment to likelihood of observed evidence. In Bayesian learning, implicit regularization prevents overfitting and drives the inference of hypotheses whose complexity matches the learning challenge. We show how these results naturally carry over to the evolutionary setting, where they are interpreted as organism complexity evolving to match the complexity of the environment, with too complex or too simple organisms suffering from \textit{overfitness} and \textit{underfitness}, respectively. Other aspects, peculiar to evolution and not to learning, reveal additional trends. One such trend is that frequently changing environments decrease selected complexity, a result with potential implications to both evolution and learning. Together, our results suggest that the balance between over-adaptation to transient environmental features, and insufficient flexiblity in responding to environmental challenges, drives the emergence of optimal complexity, reflecting environmental structure. This framework offers new ways of thinking about biological complexity, suggesting new potential causes for it to increase or decrease in different environments.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03187v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03187v1,"q-bio.PE, cs.NE"
A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss: Adaptive Policy Optimization for Stable   Self-Evaluation in Large Multimodal Models,"Wenkai Wang, Hongcan Guo, Zheqi Lv, Shengyu Zhang","Self-evaluation, a model's ability to assess the correctness of its own output, is crucial for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to achieve self-improvement in multi-turn conversations, yet largely absent in foundation models. Recent work has employed reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance self-evaluation; however, its fixed reward mechanism suffers from reward hacking when optimizing multiple training objectives, leading to model collapse. In this paper we propose AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning framework capable of adaptively adjusting training objective in real time according to the current training state for each task. Specifically, to mitigate reward hacking , AdaPO introduces an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM assesses the task's training state from the distribution of model generated multi-turn trajectories' performance. Reward Aware Dynamic KL replaces a fixed penalty with dynamic coefficients which is modulated by the reward gap between different multi-turn situations. Notably, our method automatically and smoothly adjusts its learning focus based on sub-tasks' training progress without manual intervention. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks and various models show that our method significantly enhances both direct reasoning and self-evaluation capability.

Unifying Locality of KANs and Feature Drift Compensation Projection for   Data-free Replay based Continual Face Forgery Detection,"Tianshuo Zhang, Siran Peng, Li Gao, Haoyuan Zhang, Xiangyu Zhu, Zhen Lei","The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector (DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance while notably reducing forgetting.",2025-08-05,2025-08-14,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03189v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03189v2,cs.CV
PatchDSU: Uncertainty Modeling for Out of Distribution Generalization in   Keyword Spotting,"Bronya Roni Chernyak, Yael Segal, Yosi Shrem, Joseph Keshet","Deep learning models excel at many tasks but rely on the assumption that training and test data follow the same distribution. This assumption often does not hold in real-world speech systems, where distribution shifts are common due to varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity.   The method of Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) augments the input of each neural network layer based on the input feature statistics. It addresses the problem of out-of-domain generalization by assuming feature statistics follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution and substitutes the input with sampled features from this distribution. While effective for computer vision, applying DSU to speech presents challenges due to the nature of the data. Unlike static visual data, speech is a temporal signal commonly represented by a spectrogram - the change of frequency over time. This representation cannot be treated as a simple image, and the resulting sparsity can lead to skewed feature statistics when applied to the entire input.   To tackle out-of-distribution issues in keyword spotting, we propose PatchDSU, which extends DSU by splitting the input into patches and independently augmenting each patch. We evaluated PatchDSU and DSU alongside other methods on the Google Speech Commands, Librispeech, and TED-LIUM. Additionally, we evaluated performance under white Gaussian and MUSAN music noise conditions. We also explored out-of-domain generalization by analyzing model performance on datasets they were not trained on. Overall, in most cases, both PatchDSU and DSU outperform other methods. Notably, PatchDSU demonstrates more consistent improvements across the evaluated scenarios compared to other approaches.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03190v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03190v1,"eess.AS, cs.LG"
"Scaling DRL for Decision Making: A Survey on Data, Network, and Training   Budget Strategies","Yi Ma, Hongyao Tang, Chenjun Xiao, Yaodong Yang, Wei Wei, Jianye Hao, Jiye Liang","In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network, and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions, ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot control, autonomous driving and LLM training.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03194v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03194v1,cs.LG
Multilevel inserting constructions for constant dimension subspace codes,"Gang Wang, Xuan Gao, Sihem Mesnager, Fang-Wei Fu","Subspace codes, especially constant dimension subspace codes (CDCs), represent an intriguing domain that can be used to conduct basic coding theory investigations. They have received widespread attention due to their applications in random network coding. This paper presents inverse bilateral multilevel construction by introducing inverse bilateral identifying vectors and inverse bilateral Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes. By inserting the inverse bilateral multilevel construction into the double multilevel construction and bilateral multilevel construction, an effective construction for CDCs is provided. Furthermore, via providing a new set of bilateral identifying vectors, we give another efficient construction for CDCs. In this article, several CDCs are exhibited, equipped with the rank-metric, with larger sizes than the known ones in the existing literature. From a practical standpoint, our results could help in the pragmatic framework of constant-dimension-lifted rank-metric codes for applications in network coding. The ratio of the new lower bound to the known upper bound for some CDCs is calculated, which is greater than 0.94548 for any prime power $q \geq 3.$",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03196v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03196v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"
Neovascularization Segmentation via a Multilateral Interaction-Enhanced   Graph Convolutional Network,"Tao Chen, Dan Zhang, Da Chen, Huazhu Fu, Kai Jin, Shanshan Wang, Laurent D. Cohen, Yitian Zhao, Quanyong Yi, Jiong Zhang","Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus, accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR) and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism, enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally, an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03197v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03197v1,cs.CV
Beyond Content: How Grammatical Gender Shapes Visual Representation in   Text-to-Image Models,"Muhammed Saeed, Shaina Raza, Ashmal Vayani, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, Ali Emami, Shady Shehata","Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models. Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\% on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects. Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.",2025-08-05,2025-08-10,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03199v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03199v2,cs.CL
GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models,"Marco Simoni, Aleksandar Fontana, Giulio Rossolini, Andrea Saracino","Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.",2025-08-05,2025-08-27,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03772v3,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL"
AlignCAT: Visual-Linguistic Alignment of Category and Attributefor   Weakly Supervised Visual Grounding,"Yidan Wang, Chenyi Zhuang, Wutao Liu, Pan Gao, Nicu Sebe","Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information and global context, effectively mitigating interference from category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG tasks.

Thermodynamic Signature of Logical Depth in Quantum Circuits,Issam Ibnouhsein,"We demonstrate that the internal logical structure of a quantum circuit can leave a distinct thermodynamic signature under progressive decoherence. By comparing deep, conditionally branching circuits with shallow, uniform counterparts-while controlling for overall halting probability and physical resources-we show that branching architectures induce greater entropy flow into the environment. This effect is captured by a logical depth factor $L_d$, which quantifies entropy accumulation during environmental interactions. We validate our framework through detailed analysis of two 4-branch quantum circuits, demonstrating greater entropy production with $L_d \approx 1.615$ for conditional versus uniform architectures. An ancilla-based experimental protocol using controlled-phase gates provides a concrete pathway for detecting these thermodynamic signatures on current quantum platforms.

Current State in Privacy-Preserving Text Preprocessing for   Domain-Agnostic NLP,"Abhirup Sinha, Pritilata Saha, Tithi Saha","Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03204v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03204v1,cs.CL
Open-Vocabulary HOI Detection with Interaction-aware Prompt and Concept   Calibration,"Ting Lei, Shaofeng Yin, Qingchao Chen, Yuxin Peng, Yang Liu","Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues, we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets.

GeoShield: Safeguarding Geolocation Privacy from Vision-Language Models   via Adversarial Perturbations,"Xinwei Liu, Xiaojun Jia, Yuan Xun, Simeng Qin, Xiaochun Cao","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating privacy concerns.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03209v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03209v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"

However, the ``structural probes'' that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold. First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall, this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.

The Power of Many: Synergistic Unification of Diverse Augmentations for   Efficient Adversarial Robustness,"Wang Yu-Hang, Shiwei Li, Jianxiang Liao, Li Bohan, Jian Liu, Wenfei Yin","Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models. Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore, developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the online generation of adversarial examples during training.

A System Model Generation Benchmark from Natural Language Requirements,"Dongming Jin, Zhi Jin, Linyu Li, Zheng Fang, Jia Li, Xiaohong Chen","System models, a critical artifact in software development, provide a formal abstraction of both the structural and behavioral aspects of software systems, which can facilitate the early requirements analysis and architecture design. However, developing system models remains challenging due to the specific syntax of model description languages and the relative scarcity of public model examples. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating code with programming languages and could potentially aid in system model development, no benchmarks currently exist for evaluating their ability to generate system models with specific description languages. We present SysMBench, which comprises 151 human-curated scenarios spanning a wide range of popular domains and varying difficulty levels. Each scenario mainly comprises a natural language requirements description, a system model expressed in a specific model description language, and a visualized system model diagram. The requirements description is fed as user input to the LLM, the system model with description language is used to verify if the generated system model conforms to the requirements, and the visualized diagram serves to support manual validation. We introduce SysMEval, a semantic-aware evaluation metric to evaluate the quality of generated system models. We evaluate 17 popular LLMs on this task with three traditional metrics and SysMEval, from directly prompting to three commonly used enhancement strategies. Our in-depth evaluation shows that LLMs perform poorly on SysMBench, with the highest BLEU of 4% and SysMEval-F1 of 62%.

ActionSink: Toward Precise Robot Manipulation with Dynamic Integration   of Action Flow,"Shanshan Guo, Xiwen Liang, Junfan Lin, Yuzheng Zhuang, Liang Lin, Xiaodan Liang","Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance. To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e., ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos, called ""action flow"", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically, ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\% success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03218v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03218v1,cs.CV
BadBlocks: Low-Cost and Stealthy Backdoor Attacks Tailored for   Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Yu Pan, Jiahao Chen, Lin Wang, Bingrong Dai, Yi Du","In recent years, Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30% of the computational resources and 20% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.",2025-08-05,2025-08-20,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03221v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03221v3,"cs.CR, cs.CV"
Revisiting Deep Information Propagation: Fractal Frontier and   Finite-size Effects,"Giuseppe Alessio D'Inverno, Zhiyuan Hu, Leo Davy, Michael Unser, Gianluigi Rozza, Jonathan Dong","Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03222v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03222v1,cs.LG
Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning and Prompt-Based Learning: A Comparative   Study for developing Natural Language-Based BIM Information Retrieval Systems,"Han Gao, Timo Hartmann, Botao Zhong, Kai Lia, Hanbin Luo","Building Information Modeling (BIM) is essential for managing building data across the entire lifecycle, supporting tasks from design to maintenance. Natural Language Interface (NLI) systems are increasingly explored as user-friendly tools for information retrieval in Building Information Modeling (BIM) environments. Despite their potential, accurately extracting BIM-related data through natural language queries remains a persistent challenge due to the complexity use queries and specificity of domain knowledge. This study presents a comparative analysis of two prominent approaches for developing NLI-based BIM information retrieval systems: domain-specific fine-tuning and prompt-based learning using large language models (LLMs). A two-stage framework consisting of intent recognition and table-based question answering is implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of both approaches. To support this evaluation, a BIM-specific dataset of 1,740 annotated queries of varying types across 69 models is constructed. Experimental results show that domain-specific fine-tuning delivers superior performance in intent recognition tasks, while prompt-based learning, particularly with GPT-4o, shows strength in table-based question answering. Based on these findings, this study identify a hybrid configuration that combines fine-tuning for intent recognition with prompt-based learning for question answering, achieving more balanced and robust performance across tasks. This integrated approach is further tested through case studies involving BIM models of varying complexity. This study provides a systematic analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach and discusses the applicability of the NLI to real-world BIM scenarios. The findings offer insights for researchers and practitioners in designing intelligent, language-driven BIM systems.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05676v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05676v1,"cs.IR, cs.LG"
Trace3D: Consistent Segmentation Lifting via Gaussian Instance Tracing,"Hongyu Shen, Junfeng Ni, Yixin Chen, Weishuo Li, Mingtao Pei, Siyuan Huang","We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting) and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03227v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03227v1,cs.CV
AMP-based Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation for Massive   Grant-Free Access in OFDM-based Wideband Systems,"Zhiyan Li, Ying Cui, Danny H. K. Tsang","To realize orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based grant-free access for wideband systems under frequency-selective fading, existing device activity detection and channel estimation methods need substantial accuracy improvement or computation time reduction. In this paper, we aim to resolve this issue. First, we present an exact time-domain signal model for OFDM-based grant-free access under frequency-selective fading. Then, we present a maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based device activity detection problem and two minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based channel estimation problems. The MAP-based device activity detection problem and one of the MMSE-based channel estimation problems are formulated for the first time. Next, we build a new factor graph that captures the exact statistics of time-domain channels and device activities. Based on it, we propose two approximate message passing (AMP)-based algorithms, AMP-A-EC and AMP-A-AC, to approximately solve the MAP-based device activity detection problem and two MMSE-based channel estimation problems. Both proposed algorithms alleviate the AMP's inherent convergence problem when the pilot length is smaller or comparable to the number of active devices. Then, we analyze AMP-A-EC's error probability of activity detection and mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation via state evolution and show that AMP-A-AC has the lower computational complexity (in dominant term). Finally, numerical results show the two proposed AMP-based algorithms' superior performance and respective preferable regions, revealing their significant values for OFDM-based grant-free access.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06540v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06540v1,"cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT"
CookBench: A Long-Horizon Embodied Planning Benchmark for Complex   Cooking Scenarios,"Muzhen Cai, Xiubo Chen, Yining An, Jiaxin Zhang, Xuesong Wang, Wang Xu, Weinan Zhang, Ting Liu","Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios. By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process. First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model, revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex, long-horizon tasks.

However, conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets - without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines, demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations, and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis.

FFHQ-Makeup: Paired Synthetic Makeup Dataset with Facial Consistency   Across Multiple Styles,"Xingchao Yang, Shiori Ueda, Yuantian Huang, Tomoya Akiyama, Takafumi Taketomi","Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression, undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.",2025-08-05,2025-08-06,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03241v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03241v2,cs.CV
MVTOP: Multi-View Transformer-based Object Pose-Estimation,"Lukas Ranftl, Felix Brendel, Bertram Drost, Carsten Steger","We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features, our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03243v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03243v1,cs.CV
Ultralight Polarity-Split Neuromorphic SNN for Event-Stream   Super-Resolution,"Chuanzhi Xu, Haoxian Zhou, Langyi Chen, Yuk Ying Chung, Qiang Qu","Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range.

To further reduce model size, we introduce a novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN. Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss (LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference time.

On Conformal Machine Unlearning,"Yahya Alkhatib, Wee Peng Tay","The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP), providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method designed to optimize these conformal metrics.

Force-Compliance MPC and Robot-User CBFs for Interactive Navigation and   User-Robot Safety in Hexapod Guide Robots,"Zehua Fan, Feng Gao, Zhijun Chen, Yunpeng Yin, Limin Yang, Qingxing Xi, En Yang, Xuefeng Luo","Guiding the visually impaired in complex environments requires real-time two-way interaction and safety assurance. We propose a Force-Compliance Model Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots. FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS) method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman filtering.

"Somatic in the East, Psychological in the West?: Investigating   Clinically-Grounded Cross-Cultural Depression Symptom Expression in LLMs","Shintaro Sakai, Jisun An, Migyeong Kang, Haewoon Kwak","Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong, culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for safe and effective mental health applications.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03247v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03247v1,"cs.CL, cs.CY"
RooseBERT: A New Deal For Political Language Modelling,"Deborah Dore, Elena Cabrio, Serena Villata","The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging, even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.

Full-History Graphs with Edge-Type Decoupled Networks for Temporal   Reasoning,"Osama Mohammed, Jiaxin Pan, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Daniel Hernández, Steffen Staab","Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i) intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii) inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines, lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++ illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%).

Robust Single-Stage Fully Sparse 3D Object Detection via Detachable   Latent Diffusion,"Wentao Qu, Guofeng Mei, Jing Wang, Yujiao Wu, Xiaoshui Huang, Liang Xiao","Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust 3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this, we propose a Robust single-stage fully Sparse 3D object Detection Network with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations. Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference, further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art detection.",2025-08-05,2025-08-27,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03252v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03252v2,cs.CV
Approximate Proportionality in Online Fair Division,"Davin Choo, Winston Fu, Derek Khu, Tzeh Yuan Neoh, Tze-Yang Poon, Nicholas Teh","We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved. We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03253v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03253v1,"cs.GT, cs.AI, cs.MA"

However, existing distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality. To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO, that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2% and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full models.

To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy. The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner.

However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2) multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines, particularly in style reproduction and content preservation.

SmartLLMs Scheduler: A Framework for Cost-Effective LLMs Utilization,"Yueyue Liu, Hongyu Zhang, Yuantian Miao","Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time reduction of 63.28%.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03258v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03258v1,cs.SE
Exploring Stability-Plasticity Trade-offs for Continual Named Entity   Recognition,"Duzhen Zhang, Chenxing Li, Jiahua Dong, Qi Liu, Dong Yu","Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types. Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover, we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03259v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03259v1,cs.CL
Pay What LLM Wants: Can LLM Simulate Economics Experiment with 522   Real-human Persona?,"Junhyuk Choi, Hyeonchu Park, Haemin Lee, Hyebeen Shin, Hyun Joung Jin, Bugeun Kim","Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real 522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based simulation in computational social science.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03262v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03262v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
EgoPrompt: Prompt Learning for Egocentric Action Recognition,"Huaihai Lyu, Chaofan Chen, Yuheng Ji, Changsheng Xu","Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon (i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.",2025-08-05,2025-08-07,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03266v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03266v2,cs.CV
HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding,"Pusen Dong, Chenglong Cao, Xinyu Zhou, Jirong You, Linhe Xu, Feifan Xu, Shuo Yuan","Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB). Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations, and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.",2025-08-05,2025-08-08,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03267v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03267v3,cs.LG
Towards Interpretable Concept Learning over Time Series via Temporal   Logic Semantics,"Irene Ferfoglia, Simone Silvetti, Gaia Saveri, Laura Nenzi, Luca Bortolussi","Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model decisions.",2025-08-05,2025-08-27,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03269v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03269v2,cs.LG
The alpha-beta divergence for real and complex data,Sergio Cruces,"Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains in which the underlying data are inherently complex.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03272v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03272v1,"cs.LG, cs.IT, math.IT, stat.ML"
Investigating the Cognitive Response of Brake Lights in Initiating   Braking Action Using EEG,"Ramaswamy Palaniappan, Surej Mouli, Howard Bowman, Ian McLoughlin","Half of all road accidents result from either lack of driver attention or from maintaining insufficient separation between vehicles. Collision from the rear, in particular, has been identified as the most common class of accident in the UK, and its influencing factors have been widely studied for many years. Rear-mounted stop lamps, illuminated when braking, are the primary mechanism to alert following drivers to the need to reduce speed or brake. This paper develops a novel brain response approach to measuring subject reaction to different brake light designs. A variety of off-the-shelf brake light assemblies are tested in a physical simulated driving environment to assess the cognitive reaction times of 22 subjects. Eight pairs of LED-based and two pairs of incandescent bulb-based brake light assemblies are used and electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded. Channel Pz is utilised to extract the P3 component evoked during the decision making process that occurs in the brain when a participant decides to lift their foot from the accelerator and depress the brake. EEG analysis shows that both incandescent bulb-based lights are statistically slower to evoke cognitive responses than all tested LED-based lights. Between the LED designs, differences are evident, but not statistically significant, attributed to the significant amount of movement artifact in the EEG signal.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03274v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03274v1,"eess.SP, cs.ET, cs.HC, cs.IR"
LECTOR: LLM-Enhanced Concept-based Test-Oriented Repetition for Adaptive   Spaced Learning,Jiahao Zhao,"Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference and personalized adaptation.

Do language models accommodate their users? A study of linguistic   convergence,"Terra Blevins, Susanne Schmalwieser, Benjamin Roth","While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking: do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific, we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are very different.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03276v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03276v1,cs.CL
Efficient Multi-Slide Visual-Language Feature Fusion for Placental   Disease Classification,"Hang Guo, Qing Zhang, Zixuan Gao, Siyuan Yang, Shulin Peng, Xiang Tao, Ting Yu, Yan Wang, Qingli Li","Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1) inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD.

Artificial Intelligence and Generative Models for Materials Discovery --   A Review,"Albertus Denny Handoko, Riko I Made","High throughput experimentation tools, machine learning (ML) methods, and open material databases are radically changing the way new materials are discovered.

Understanding the Embedding Models on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graph,"Yubo Wang, Shimin Di, Zhili Wang, Haoyang Li, Fei Teng, Hao Xin, Lei Chen","Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information. Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue. To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03280v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03280v1,"cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.SI"

Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of online Continual Learning on graphs.

In this work, we introduce ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user interactions.

Utilizing 5G, with its low latency and high bandwidth, enables seamless vehicle-to-cloud integration. Currently, only non-standalone 5G is publicly available, and real-world applications remain underexplored compared to theoretical studies. This paper evaluates 5G non-standalone networks for cloud execution of vehicle functions, focusing on latency, Round Trip Time, and packet delivery. Tests used two AI-based algorithms -- emotion recognition and object recognition -- along an 8.8 km route in Baden-W\""urttemberg, Germany, encompassing urban, rural, and forested areas.

Key findings highlight an average signal quality of 84 %, with no connectivity interruptions despite minor drops in built-up areas. Packet analysis revealed a Packet Error Rate below 0.1 % for both algorithms.

Strategic Hypothesis Testing,"Safwan Hossain, Yatong Chen, Yiling Chen","We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product, submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights using publicly available data on drug approvals.

Investigation on deep learning-based galaxy image translation models,"Hengxin Ruan, Qiufan Lin, Shupei Chen, Yang Wang, Wei Zhang","Galaxy image translation is an important application in galaxy physics and cosmology. With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the development of image translation models for scientific use.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03291v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03291v1,"astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, cs.CV"
Investigating Gender Bias in LLM-Generated Stories via Psychological   Stereotypes,"Shahed Masoudian, Gustavo Escobedo, Hannah Strauss, Markus Schedl","As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work, we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1) While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03292v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03292v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Enhancing Joint Human-AI Inference in Robot Missions: A Confidence-Based   Approach,"Duc-An Nguyen, Clara Colombatto, Steve Fleming, Ingmar Posner, Nick Hawes, Raunak Bhattacharyya","Joint human-AI inference holds immense potential to improve outcomes in human-supervised robot missions. Current day missions are generally in the AI-assisted setting, where the human operator makes the final inference based on the AI recommendation. However, due to failures in human judgement on when to accept or reject the AI recommendation, complementarity is rarely achieved. We investigate joint human-AI inference where the inference made with higher confidence is selected. Through a user study with N=100 participants on a representative simulated robot teleoperation task, specifically studying the inference of robots' control delays we show that: a) Joint inference accuracy is higher and its extent is regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI agent, and b) Humans change their inferences based on AI recommendations and the extent and direction of this change is also regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI agent. Interestingly, our results show that pairing poorly-calibrated AI-DSS with humans hurts performance instead of helping the team, reiterating the need for AI-based decision support systems with good metacognitive sensitivity.

NLP Methods May Actually Be Better Than Professors at Estimating   Question Difficulty,"Leonidas Zotos, Ivo Pascal de Jong, Matias Valdenegro-Toro, Andreea Ioana Sburlea, Malvina Nissim, Hedderik van Rijn","Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03294v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03294v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Towards Trustworthy Multimodal Moderation via Policy-Aligned Reasoning   and Hierarchical Labeling,"Anqi Li, Wenwei Jin, Jintao Tong, Pengda Qin, Weijia Li, Guo Lu","Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term ""Hierarchical"" reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy content safety systems.

GUI-ReRank: Enhancing GUI Retrieval with Multi-Modal LLM-based Reranking,"Kristian Kolthoff, Felix Kretzer, Christian Bartelt, Alexander Maedche, Simone Paolo Ponzetto","GUI prototyping is a fundamental component in the development of modern interactive systems, which are now ubiquitous across diverse application domains. GUI prototypes play a critical role in requirements elicitation by enabling stakeholders to visualize, assess, and refine system concepts collaboratively. Moreover, prototypes serve as effective tools for early testing, iterative evaluation, and validation of design ideas with both end users and development teams. Despite these advantages, the process of constructing GUI prototypes remains resource-intensive and time-consuming, frequently demanding substantial effort and expertise. Recent research has sought to alleviate this burden through NL-based GUI retrieval approaches, which typically rely on embedding-based retrieval or tailored ranking models for specific GUI repositories. However, these methods often suffer from limited retrieval performance and struggle to generalize across arbitrary GUI datasets. In this work, we present GUI-ReRank, a novel framework that integrates rapid embedding-based constrained retrieval models with highly effective MLLM-based reranking techniques. GUI-ReRank further introduces a fully customizable GUI repository annotation and embedding pipeline, enabling users to effortlessly make their own GUI repositories searchable, which allows for rapid discovery of relevant GUIs for inspiration or seamless integration into customized LLM-based RAG workflows. We evaluated our approach on an established NL-based GUI retrieval benchmark, demonstrating that GUI-ReRank significantly outperforms SOTA tailored LTR models in both retrieval accuracy and generalizability. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive cost and efficiency analysis of employing MLLMs for reranking, providing valuable insights regarding the trade-offs between retrieval effectiveness and computational resources.

Zero Shot Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation by Synthetic Data   Generation and Progressive Adaptation,"Jun Luo, Zijing Zhao, Yang Liu","Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy, ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot semantic segmentation.

Reliable Evaluation Protocol for Low-Precision Retrieval,"Kisu Yang, Yoonna Jang, Hwanseok Jang, Kenneth Choi, Isabelle Augenstein, Heuiseok Lim","Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.",2025-08-05,2025-08-06,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03306v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03306v2,"cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.CL"
BDFirewall: Towards Effective and Expeditiously Black-Box Backdoor   Defense in MLaaS,"Ye Li, Chengcheng Zhu, Yanchao Zhao, Jiale Zhang","In this paper, we endeavor to address the challenges of backdoor attacks countermeasures in black-box scenarios, thereby fortifying the security of inference under MLaaS. We first categorize backdoor triggers from a new perspective, i.e., their impact on the patched area, and divide them into: high-visibility triggers (HVT), semi-visibility triggers (SVT), and low-visibility triggers (LVT). Based on this classification, we propose a progressive defense framework, BDFirewall, that removes these triggers from the most conspicuous to the most subtle, without requiring model access. First, for HVTs, which create the most significant local semantic distortions, we identify and eliminate them by detecting these salient differences. We then restore the patched area to mitigate the adverse impact of such removal process. The localized purification designed for HVTs is, however, ineffective against SVTs, which globally perturb benign features. We therefore model an SVT-poisoned input as a mixture of a trigger and benign features, where we unconventionally treat the benign features as ""noise"". This formulation allows us to reconstruct SVTs by applying a denoising process that removes these benign ""noise"" features. The SVT-free input is then obtained by subtracting the reconstructed trigger. Finally, to neutralize the nearly imperceptible but fragile LVTs, we introduce lightweight noise to disrupt the trigger pattern and then apply DDPM to restore any collateral impact on clean features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art defenses. Compared with baselines, BDFirewall reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average of 33.25%, improving poisoned sample accuracy (PA) by 29.64%, and achieving up to a 111x speedup in inference time. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03307v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03307v1,cs.CR
BaroPoser: Real-time Human Motion Tracking from IMUs and Barometers in   Everyday Devices,"Libo Zhang, Xinyu Yi, Feng Xu","In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03313v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03313v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
A Dual Optimization View to Empirical Risk Minimization with   f-Divergence Regularization,"Francisco Daunas, Iñaki Esnaola, Samir M. Perlaza","The dual formulation of empirical risk minimization with f-divergence regularization (ERM-fDR) is introduced. The solution of the dual optimization problem to the ERM-fDR is connected to the notion of normalization function introduced as an implicit function. This dual approach leverages the Legendre-Fenchel transform and the implicit function theorem to provide a nonlinear ODE expression to the normalization function. Furthermore, the nonlinear ODE expression and its properties provide a computationally efficient method to calculate the normalization function of the ERM-fDR solution under a mild condition.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03314v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03314v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG"
Bridging ocean wave physics and deep learning: Physics-informed neural   operators for nonlinear wavefield reconstruction in real-time,"Svenja Ehlers, Merten Stender, Norbert Hoffmann","Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions, thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and prediction in realistic marine environments.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03315v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03315v1,cs.LG
Architectural Insights into Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection:   A Comprehensive Review,"Mahdi Golizadeh, Nassibeh Golizadeh, Mohammad Ali Keyvanrad, Hossein Shirazi","Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD) provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods, distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level, neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation). We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03317v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03317v1,"cs.CV, 68T07, I.4.8"

Bidirectional TLS Handshake Caching for Constrained Industrial IoT   Scenarios,"Jörn Bodenhausen, Simon Mangel, Thomas Vogt, Martin Henze","While TLS has become the de-facto standard for end-to-end security, its use to secure critical communication in evolving industrial IoT scenarios is severely limited by prevalent resource constraints of devices and networks. Most notably, the TLS handshake to establish secure connections incurs significant bandwidth and processing overhead that often cannot be handled in constrained environments. To alleviate this situation, we present BiTHaC which realizes bidirectional TLS handshake caching by exploiting that significant parts of repeated TLS handshakes, especially certificates, are static. Thus, redundant information neither needs to be transmitted nor corresponding computations performed, saving valuable bandwidth and processing resources. By implementing BiTHaC for wolfSSL, we show that we can reduce the bandwidth consumption of TLS handshakes by up to 61.1% and the computational overhead by up to 8.5%, while incurring only well-manageable memory overhead and preserving the strict security guarantees of TLS.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03321v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03321v1,"cs.NI, cs.CR"
Software Fairness Dilemma: Is Bias Mitigation a Zero-Sum Game?,"Zhenpeng Chen, Xinyue Li, Jie M. Zhang, Weisong Sun, Ying Xiao, Tianlin Li, Yiling Lou, Yang Liu","Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software, driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However, it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion, where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation methods.",2025-08-05,2025-08-05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03323v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03323v1,cs.LG

We analyze five non-Newtonian dynamic 3D blood flow cases within a realistic aortic model, covering a range of hematocrit values from anemic to polycythemic conditions. To enhance state estimation results, we consider various design and training techniques for PINNs, including adaptive loss balancing, curriculum training, and a realistic measurement operator. Regarding blood rheology, the PINN approach accurately estimates viscosity globally and locally under peak systolic conditions. It also provides a clear pattern recognition for diastolic stages. Regarding mass conservation, PINN estimations effectively reproduce the bifurcation of flow through the different branches of the aorta, demonstrate an excellent representation of the non-slip conditions at the walls, and accurately estimate pressure drops with relative errors below the 5% in the whole pressure field. We test our pressure drop estimations against the state of the art Virtual Work Energy Relative Pressure (vWERP) estimator, and we observe how our results outperform vWERP in terms of both accuracy and time resolution.
